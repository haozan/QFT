00:00:08.133</b><br>just dead and bitcoins got me scratching my head<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.133 - 00:00:10.000</b><br>I'm starting to rhyme on video<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.900 - 00:00:14.500</b><br>oh man this is just insanity like this whole<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.500 - 00:00:17.000</b><br>China banned the Icos<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.300 - 00:00:19.300</b><br>and so forth thing and<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.366 - 00:00:20.600</b><br>causing a panic<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.600 - 00:00:23.900</b><br>but a panic that didn't really hit our bases<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.100 - 00:00:24.900</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.333 - 00:00:28.500</b><br>let's just Mark up this chart for fun even though I'm<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.766 - 00:00:30.900</b><br>actually starting to run out of Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.900 - 00:00:33.300</b><br>like I've sold so much Bitcoin now<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.500 - 00:00:34.200</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.200 - 00:00:36.766</b><br>my reserves are running low and don't get me wrong<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.766 - 00:00:39.733</b><br>I'm really happy to have profited so much<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.000 - 00:00:42.100</b><br>you know like just you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.100 - 00:00:43.800</b><br>a month ago we're at 1800<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.800 - 00:00:45.666</b><br>dollars in bitcoin and now we're<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.966 - 00:00:47.900</b><br>back to close to 5,000 again<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.900 - 00:00:50.733</b><br>so I mean those percentages are huge and<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.733 - 00:00:53.733</b><br>you know that really grew my account massively<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.966 - 00:00:56.866</b><br>but now my reserves are getting low and I'm like<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.966 - 00:00:58.966</b><br>what am I going to sell all of my bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.133 - 00:00:59.566</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.566 - 00:01:01.866</b><br>so let me explain to you what's going on with me<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.866 - 00:01:04.900</b><br>but this is just making me shake my head<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.200 - 00:01:06.000</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.966 - 00:01:10.866</b><br>our obvious base let's Mark this chart up for fun<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.866 - 00:01:13.966</b><br>obvious base was somewhere between 36 and 37<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.566 - 00:01:17.266</b><br>you know that was our obvious base and I know<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.266 - 00:01:18.400</b><br>with all my little<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.900 - 00:01:20.800</b><br>cells and buys here all over the chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.800 - 00:01:22.366</b><br>it's not making it easy<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.366 - 00:01:24.333</b><br>so let's just take those off for a second<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.366 - 00:01:31.666</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.933 - 00:01:34.133</b><br>obviously obviously this was our base<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.133 - 00:01:36.300</b><br>this is what I was waiting to crack right<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.700 - 00:01:40.533</b><br>and so you know we get close to the 5,000<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.900 - 00:01:43.900</b><br>and then and then that makes a little panic because<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.900 - 00:01:45.966</b><br>5000 is that psychological number<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.366 - 00:01:48.766</b><br>so that makes a little bit of a panic it drops<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.800 - 00:01:51.700</b><br>and then we get that ICO news and then it drops again<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.000 - 00:01:52.800</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.000 - 00:01:54.966</b><br>you know here I am waiting for the<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.966 - 00:01:57.000</b><br>crack of this base like come on<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.000 - 00:01:58.133</b><br>give us a crack<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.200 - 00:02:00.566</b><br>but the ICO news is really more about<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.666 - 00:02:03.200</b><br>Ethereum and whatnot not really so much about Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.266 - 00:02:05.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.133 - 00:02:07.500</b><br>but here's the thing I didn't realize I just<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.566 - 00:02:09.300</b><br>I wasn't thinking clearly<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.266 - 00:02:13.566</b><br>we had a long weekend<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.966 - 00:02:14.766</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.533 - 00:02:17.966</b><br>that long weekend meant that a lot of people<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.966 - 00:02:19.766</b><br>couldn't go ahead and<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.866 - 00:02:23.100</b><br>and send money to the exchanges you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.100 - 00:02:24.766</b><br>because the banks are closed and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.866 - 00:02:26.766</b><br>and I just never thought about that<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.900 - 00:02:28.300</b><br>so this long weekend could have<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.300 - 00:02:29.533</b><br>easily affected this<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.533 - 00:02:31.700</b><br>because as soon as the long weekend was over<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.966 - 00:02:33.866</b><br>the things started to bounce really big<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.600 - 00:02:37.066</b><br>and I would have gotten a little bit heavier<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.066 - 00:02:38.866</b><br>let's go back to show my orders<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.666 - 00:02:43.300</b><br>I would have gotten a little bit heavier on these<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.533 - 00:02:46.200</b><br>buys had I thought that out<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.200 - 00:02:47.366</b><br>but I just didn't even<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.366 - 00:02:47.966</b><br>occur to me that<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.966 - 00:02:50.100</b><br>that's one of the things that was playing into this<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.100 - 00:02:52.200</b><br>game mentality what was happening<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.333 - 00:02:53.133</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.566 - 00:02:55.733</b><br>this is a nibble<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.933 - 00:02:59.933</b><br>you know like if we zoom right in we had this nice drop<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.300 - 00:03:03.500</b><br>and you know you can't call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.500 - 00:03:04.300</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.333 - 00:03:07.566</b><br>you know obvious base is back here at 36 to 37<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.300 - 00:03:10.933</b><br>you can't call this 43 a base<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.366 - 00:03:12.333</b><br>but we hit<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.333 - 00:03:14.366</b><br>because we hit this 43 and we got a bounce from<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.366 - 00:03:16.400</b><br>43 to 47<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.933 - 00:03:22.300</b><br>like 7% or 8% bounce that's not much of a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.500 - 00:03:25.266</b><br>so I could only play this for fun<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.266 - 00:03:26.866</b><br>so I just took a little nibble here<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.866 - 00:03:28.133</b><br>and then sold and sold<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.866 - 00:03:30.933</b><br>right and then of course when we crack this<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.933 - 00:03:32.566</b><br>which is still not a base<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.400 - 00:03:35.700</b><br>I took a little nibble and I sold and sold<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.966 - 00:03:38.066</b><br>you know like because these are just little day trades<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.066 - 00:03:39.200</b><br>so all of these<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.533 - 00:03:42.800</b><br>cells here where I sold and sold and sold and sold<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.400 - 00:03:44.800</b><br>this is my actual bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.800 - 00:03:45.500</b><br>I'm selling<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.500 - 00:03:48.400</b><br>you know like the stuff that I haven't reserved<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.766 - 00:03:50.133</b><br>these little nibbles were<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.133 - 00:03:52.533</b><br>these cells and this little nibble was these cells<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.800 - 00:03:55.933</b><br>so I'm back to selling my bitcoinance because<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.866 - 00:03:59.533</b><br>over here where I got a nibble<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.133 - 00:04:02.066</b><br>and I sold and sold that nibble<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.266 - 00:04:04.766</b><br>then I didn't sell anything all the way up here<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.766 - 00:04:06.733</b><br>and that's because I went on a trip with my<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.733 - 00:04:09.066</b><br>brother to go buy a vehicle and I wasn't around<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.400 - 00:04:10.966</b><br>so this thing just kept on<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.966 - 00:04:12.400</b><br>grinding higher and grinding higher<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.400 - 00:04:14.133</b><br>has got so much power and strength<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.133 - 00:04:17.166</b><br>everybody is trying to buy bitcoin right now<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.333 - 00:04:19.000</b><br>and they're all planning to<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.000 - 00:04:21.333</b><br>break that 5000 and take off to the moon<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.466 - 00:04:22.666</b><br>so you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.666 - 00:04:24.200</b><br>I was gone and<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.200 - 00:04:25.500</b><br>this thing was just grinding higher<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.500 - 00:04:27.666</b><br>and I missed out on getting some cells in there<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.566 - 00:04:30.466</b><br>and then when I get back<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.800 - 00:04:34.000</b><br>from my little trip ah the thing drops<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.166 - 00:04:37.100</b><br>so I got to play with it a bit but so right now<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.733 - 00:04:38.366</b><br>oh<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.366 - 00:04:40.400</b><br>shoot I got a trade sorry be right back<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.400 - 00:04:42.566</b><br>sorry that was a stock market trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.866 - 00:04:44.600</b><br>I figured that the market was so<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.600 - 00:04:45.966</b><br>slow today that I'd get to make it<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.100 - 00:04:48.966</b><br>a video without having being interrupted by trades<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.966 - 00:04:50.966</b><br>but of course it still happens<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.500 - 00:04:53.966</b><br>so yeah so what I'm saying is that these cells<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.333 - 00:04:55.100</b><br>are really<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.100 - 00:04:57.866</b><br>because I missed out on getting some off over here<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.566 - 00:04:59.666</b><br>so I was just trying to get some off<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.666 - 00:05:01.900</b><br>now do I think this is gonna break 5,000 keep going<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.200 - 00:05:04.733</b><br>you know with the strength of bitcoin right now<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.733 - 00:05:05.366</b><br>yeah<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.366 - 00:05:07.866</b><br>it might easily break 5,000 and keep going<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.900 - 00:05:10.400</b><br>and I am running low on bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.666 - 00:05:11.500</b><br>like you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.500 - 00:05:12.300</b><br>I take<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.900 - 00:05:16.533</b><br>you've heard in other videos I take 30 percent of<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.133 - 00:05:18.400</b><br>my total amount<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.900 - 00:05:20.900</b><br>whenever I take profits but<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.466 - 00:05:22.166</b><br>I mean<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.166 - 00:05:24.966</b><br>look at me over here I was taking profits at 36<br></p><p><b>00:05:24.966 - 00:05:27.766</b><br>I was like holy smokes we were at 50<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.066 - 00:05:30.500</b><br>at 18 and we got to 36<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.866 - 00:05:33.400</b><br>that was a pretty big move on my account like that<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.400 - 00:05:35.500</b><br>that's like doubling your account<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.700 - 00:05:36.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.733 - 00:05:38.066</b><br>I started taking some profits<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.066 - 00:05:39.700</b><br>and I started taking some profits and okay<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.700 - 00:05:42.500</b><br>I got a nibble here and a nibble here and<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.700 - 00:05:44.866</b><br>I got to play and make a little bit of money<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.100 - 00:05:46.300</b><br>but I<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.666 - 00:05:49.200</b><br>still was playing to take some profits as we approach<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.200 - 00:05:53.166</b><br>5000 and I didn't get to because I was on that trip so<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.100 - 00:05:55.933</b><br>this is me taking those profits<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.933 - 00:05:58.566</b><br>but I mean I am running low on bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.800 - 00:06:01.300</b><br>and this bitcoin has got me scratching my head<br></p><p><b>00:06:01.300 - 00:06:02.800</b><br>because it's so strong<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.966 - 00:06:05.533</b><br>and I keep expecting I'm going to get a base crack<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.533 - 00:06:07.400</b><br>and obviously this is now a new base<br></p><p><b>00:06:07.400 - 00:06:08.800</b><br>I should put that in there too right<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.800 - 00:06:11.533</b><br>39 is definitely a base after this bounce<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.366 - 00:06:16.000</b><br>I keep expecting these basecracks<br></p><p><b>00:06:16.000 - 00:06:17.400</b><br>and it's just not happening<br></p><p><b>00:06:17.800 - 00:06:19.266</b><br>so here's a very<br></p><p><b>00:06:19.266 - 00:06:21.500</b><br>very important thing that you got to remember<br></p><p><b>00:06:21.500 - 00:06:22.200</b><br>as a traitor<br></p><p><b>00:06:22.200 - 00:06:24.000</b><br>now one of the key<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.133 - 00:06:26.733</b><br>things that you're supposed to develop is patients<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.733 -

00:09:32.766</b><br>and then it works its way back up<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.766 - 00:09:34.100</b><br>then you get a breakout<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.100 - 00:09:36.800</b><br>and it runs up and it comes back down to test that<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.800 - 00:09:38.566</b><br>so you got a breakout here of<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.766 - 00:09:39.566</b><br></p><p><b>00:09:40.266 - 00:09:41.300</b><br>of 750<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.933 - 00:09:43.600</b><br>sorry I don't have something to draw with<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.600 - 00:09:44.666</b><br>just one second<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.366 - 00:09:47.000</b><br>so you have a breakout of 750<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.133 - 00:09:48.466</b><br>and it runs all the way up to<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.466 - 00:09:50.900</b><br>1200 almost and then comes back down to 750<br></p><p><b>00:09:50.900 - 00:09:52.300</b><br>and this is normal<br></p><p><b>00:09:52.300 - 00:09:54.966</b><br>you know you got a breakout here and a run up<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.000 -

00:10:09.500</b><br>there were places for you to<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.500 - 00:10:12.000</b><br>like we normally do where you'd be able to<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.600 - 00:10:14.466</b><br>if I zoomed in on this chart<br></p><p><b>00:10:14.533 -

00:10:23.400</b><br>circle and make money<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.566 - 00:10:24.700</b><br>so there'd still be way<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.200 - 00:10:27.200</b><br>there's are ways of trading this<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.366 -

00:10:37.600</b><br>and then you get a pullback down to<br></p><p><b>00:10:38.400 - 00:10:40.266</b><br>where you broke out and retest it<br></p><p><b>00:10:40.333 - 00:10:42.666</b><br>and in this case the retest failed<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.666 - 00:10:44.933</b><br>eventually and it gave you a nice drop<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.166 - 00:10:47.800</b><br>you know which created a beautiful base over here and<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.800 - 00:10:49.466</b><br>gave you a chance to buy and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:10:49.500 - 00:10:50.166</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:10:50.166 - 00:10:51.666</b><br>this is absolutely normal<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.666 - 00:10:53.400</b><br>and then you get a little bit of a correction<br></p><p><b>00:10:53.400 - 00:10:54.966</b><br>which is even better for us right<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.966 - 00:10:56.533</b><br>this gives us a chance to<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.700 - 00:10:59.533</b><br>actually make some bitcoins get back into the game<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.666 -

00:11:24.666</b><br>sorry let me draw that breakout<br></p><p><b>00:11:25.066 - 00:11:26.766</b><br>so you've got a breakout right there<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.766 - 00:11:29.400</b><br>right there is your top and then you break out of it<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.800 - 00:11:30.600</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:11:31.800 - 00:11:33.000</b><br>you're thinking<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.700 - 00:11:34.500</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:11:34.733 - 00:11:38.500</b><br>at this high over here at 1600 you broke out at 1250<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.800 -

00:11:49.000</b><br>and then fall a little further<br></p><p><b>00:11:49.000 - 00:11:53.500</b><br>and eventually come back to retest this 1300 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:11:53.900 - 00:11:55.700</b><br>but it doesn't do it<br></p><p><b>00:11:56.800 - 00:12:00.500</b><br>instead it gives you a little bit of a pull back<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.733 - 00:12:01.666</b><br>you know to 15<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.300 - 00:12:04.300</b><br>and then runs all the way up to 19<br></p><p><b>00:12:04.300 - 00:12:06.300</b><br>and you're left with this space<br></p><p><b>00:12:06.566 - 00:12:08.333</b><br>that never gets fixed<br></p><p><b>00:12:08.800 - 00:12:10.800</b><br>you run up to 19 and then what happens<br></p><p><b>00:12:10.800 - 00:12:13.266</b><br>you're probably going to get a retest back down to 16<br></p><p><b>00:12:14.366 - 00:12:15.366</b><br>you just move the<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.566 - 00:12:16.266</b><br>thing a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:12:16.266 - 00:12:18.866</b><br>so yeah see you get a retest back down to 16<br></p><p><b>00:12:19.300 - 00:12:20.800</b><br>and you're still up above<br></p><p><b>00:12:20.800 - 00:12:22.933</b><br>and you're scratching your head right<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.933 -

00:13:34.133</b><br>and then bang<br></p><p><b>00:13:34.700 - 00:13:35.733</b><br>then you have<br></p><p><b>00:13:36.133 - 00:13:37.800</b><br>this huge drop<br></p><p><b>00:13:37.800 - 00:13:39.666</b><br>all the way down to fix that<br></p><p><b>00:13:40.300 -

00:14:07.100</b><br>I made like<br></p><p><b>00:14:07.933 - 00:14:09.800</b><br>such beautiful trades in this<br></p><p><b>00:14:10.300 - 00:14:11.766</b><br>but this thing was showing<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.766 -

00:14:19.800</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.800 - 00:14:22.566</b><br>then you know you get back to normal trading where<br></p><p><b>00:14:22.800 - 00:14:23.900</b><br>you have a<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.166 -

00:14:33.300</b><br>and it makes these beautiful bases<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.300 - 00:14:34.866</b><br>and then you get to buy these safe<br></p><p><b>00:14:34.866 - 00:14:36.900</b><br>circles and so on and so on and<br></p><p><b>00:14:36.900 - 00:14:38.866</b><br>trading resumes as normal<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.500 - 00:14:41.400</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:14:41.933 - 00:14:45.366</b><br>you make a ton of Bitcoin throughout this section<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.100 - 00:14:48.066</b><br>and then you're all fully loaded<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.800 - 00:14:50.500</b><br>and then this thing takes off<br></p><p><b>00:14:50.733 - 00:14:53.200</b><br>right but look what it does<br></p><p><b>00:14:54.800 - 00:14:56.066</b><br>it repeats this<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.066 - 00:14:59.300</b><br>process because it's becoming such a strong chart<br></p><p><b>00:14:59.600 - 00:15:01.866</b><br>and you end up with a box again<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.600 - 00:15:03.500</b><br>right that's what<br></p><p><b>00:15:03.500 - 00:15:06.066</b><br>we have that's why I thought for sure on this<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.066 - 00:15:07.066</b><br>in the past few days<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.066 - 00:15:07.700</b><br>I thought for sure<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.700 - 00:15:08.466</b><br>we're gonna come back<br></p><p><b>00:15:08.466 - 00:15:10.133</b><br>with the panic that we were getting<br></p><p><b>00:15:10.300 - 00:15:12.066</b><br>back to to fix this<br></p><p><b>00:15:12.366 - 00:15:15.766</b><br>back to 3000 and fix this little box sorry<br></p><p><b>00:15:15.766 - 00:15:16.900</b><br>I just had to go away for a second<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.900 - 00:15:18.166</b><br>again for the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.600 - 00:15:21.966</b><br>so we were talking about how this never got fixed and<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.100 - 00:15:24.266</b><br>then it kind of happened again so<br></p><p><b>00:15:24.933 - 00:15:26.666</b><br>if we just scroll a little further<br></p><p><b>00:15:27.766 - 00:15:30.400</b><br>we get this this pull back<br></p><p><b>00:15:30.600 - 00:15:32.000</b><br>you know which gave us some nice<br></p><p><b>00:15:32.266 - 00:15:32.666</b><br>few little<br></p><p><b>00:15:32.666 - 00:15:35.000</b><br>opportunities but we got this pull back down to 3600<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.300 - 00:15:39.766</b><br>and really the breakout here was at 34 50 or something<br></p><p><b>00:15:39.966 - 00:15:41.466</b><br>so we end up<br></p><p><b>00:15:42.200 - 00:15:44.266</b><br>with yet another<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.333 - 00:15:46.400</b><br>little box<br></p><p><b>00:15:49.800 - 00:15:51.500</b><br>sorry if these boxes look like circles<br></p><p><b>00:15:51.500 - 00:15:53.200</b><br>but I'm trying to make them boxes but<br></p><p><b>00:15:53.333 - 00:15:54.466</b><br>I'm doing what I can't hear<br></p><p><b>00:15:55.066 - 00:15:57.100</b><br>so we end up with another little box<br></p><p><b>00:15:57.100 - 00:16:00.000</b><br>so this chart is saying extreme strength<br></p><p><b>00:16:00.000 - 00:16:02.800</b><br>and it's not really following the rules<br></p><p><b>00:16:04.366 - 00:16:07.466</b><br>nothing price discovery is not really happening here<br></p><p><b>00:16:07.766 - 00:16:08.966</b><br>and so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:16:09.500 - 00:16:10.866</b><br>as we continue on<br></p><p><b>00:16:11.366 - 00:16:13.133</b><br>the thing gets close to 5000<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.933 - 00:16:17.733</b><br>and then all of the drama that we just saw happens<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.166 - 00:16:23.000</b><br>and I'm expecting I'm expecting a crack of this base<br></p><p><b>00:16:26.366 - 00:16:29.466</b><br>I'm hoping that the chart is going to come down and fix<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.533 - 00:16:30.966</b><br>this whole area<br></p><p><b>00:16:30.966 - 00:16:33.866</b><br>these boxes these gaps<br></p><p><b>00:16:34.100 - 00:16:35.500</b><br>and it doesn't happen<br></p><p><b>00:16:36.100 - 00:16:40.133</b><br>again it just forms another base and keeps on trucking<br></p><p><b>00:16:40.533 - 00:16:41.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.500 - 00:16:43.333</b><br>is it going to<br></p><p><b>00:16:43.333 - 00:16:48.000</b><br>break 5,000 and go to 6,000 and 7,000 and 8,000<br></p><p><b>00:16:48.333 - 00:16:50.500</b><br>according to this yeah<br></p><p><b>00:16:50.533 - 00:16:51.166</b><br>likely<br></p><p><b>00:16:51.166 - 00:16:53.766</b><br>with the strength that we're seeing it might do that<br></p><p><b>00:16:53.933 - 00:16:57.400</b><br>but will it come back down to retest 3,000<br></p><p><b>00:16:57.566 - 00:16:59.400</b><br>will it come and fix the chart<br></p><p><b>00:16:59.666 - 00:17:00.966</b><br>it always has<br></p><p><b>00:17:01.000 - 00:17:03.166</b><br>bitcoin always fixes its charts<br></p><p><b>00:17:03.333 - 00:17:06.700</b><br>so likely that the likelihood of this coming back down<br></p><p><b>00:17:06.700 - 00:17:08.500</b><br>dropping back down to 3000<br></p><p><b>00:17:08.733 - 00:17:11.000</b><br>is very very very high<br></p><p><b>00:17:11.100 - 00:17:13.866</b><br>I would say 90 whatever percent<br></p><p><b>00:17:14.300 - 00:17:16.000</b><br>99.9 percent<br></p><p><b>00:17:16.333 - 00:17:18.700</b><br>that it's going to come back down and test that 3000<br></p><p><b>00:17:18.700 - 00:17:21.000</b><br>even if it's just like back in the past here<br></p><p><b>00:17:21.000 - 00:17:23.700</b><br>even if it's just a spike even if we just<br></p><p><b>00:17:23.700 - 00:17:25.366</b><br>you know maybe make it to 6000 or<br></p><p><b>00:17:25.366 - 00:17:26.300</b><br>7000 and then<br></p><p><b>00:17:26.300 - 00:17:28.600</b><br>spike all the way back down to 3000 for a day<br></p><p><b>00:17:28.800 - 00:17:30.366</b><br>and all the way back up<br></p><p><b>00:17:31.600 - 00:17:33.533</b><br>it usually fixes its charts<br></p><p><b>00:17:33.533 - 00:17:36.266</b><br>well it always fixes its charts as far as we know<br></p><p><b>00:17:37.366 - 00:17:41.533</b><br>so what am I doing I'm continuing to sell right<br></p><p><b>00:17:41.600 - 00:17:43.300</b><br>so I'm looking at this big picture<br></p><p><b>00:17:43.300 - 00:17:45.500</b><br>and I'm realizing that there will come a day<br></p><p><b>00:17:45.533 - 00:17:49.000</b><br>very soon where I will be able to reload at 3000<br></p><p><b>00:17:49.133 -

00:19:14.600</b><br>because my orders were at 4 30 and below<br></p><p><b>00:19:14.766 - 00:19:15.466</b><br>I was like<br></p><p><b>00:19:15.466 - 00:19:18.133</b><br>really hoping for a good panic and we got one<br></p><p><b>00:19:18.133 - 00:19:19.700</b><br>and it got to 4<br></p><p><b>00:19:19.933 - 00:19:22.933</b><br>45 and just hm<br></p><p><b>00:19:23.333 - 00:19:24.366</b><br>I just didn't get in<br></p><p><b>00:19:24.966 - 00:19:28.133</b><br>and man I wish I wish because at 4<br></p><p><b>00:19:28.133 - 00:19:30.966</b><br>30 I was starting to nibble and then I was going to buy<br></p><p><b>00:19:30.966 - 00:19:32.100</b><br>huge you know<br></p><p><b>00:19:32.133 - 00:19:34.800</b><br>all the way down into the 400 and below and<br></p><p><b>00:19:35.800 - 00:19:39.000</b><br>then look at what this thing gave us as a jump<br></p><p><b>00:19:39.300 - 00:19:41.200</b><br>all the way up to 720<br></p><p><b>00:19:41.600 - 00:19:46.133</b><br>like unbelievable almost like an 80 percent trade just<br></p><p><b>00:19:46.200 - 00:19:48.166</b><br>such a huge amount of profit there<br></p><p><b>00:19:48.933 - 00:19:51.266</b><br>anyway I missed it but hopefully<br></p><p><b>00:19:51.666 - 00:19:53.400</b><br>others participated in that<br></p><p><b>00:19:54.066 - 00:19:54.333</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:19:54.333 - 00:19:56.333</b><br>so I got to get back to trading<br></p><p><b>00:19:56.766 - 00:19:58.266</b><br>I'm sorry that there was a few<br></p><p><b>00:19:58.266 - 00:19:59.800</b><br>trees that went off while I was making this video<br></p><p><b>00:19:59.800 - 00:20:00.900</b><br>but it always happens because I am<br></p><p><b>00:20:00.900 - 00:20:01.933</b><br>trading stock market<br></p><p><b>00:20:02.566 - 00:20:05.366</b><br>so again I am scratching my head with this Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:20:05.366 - 00:20:07.700</b><br>because it is showing extreme strength<br></p><p><b>00:20:07.700 - 00:20:09.066</b><br>and hopefully now<br></p><p><b>00:20:09.066 - 00:20:10.100</b><br>everybody who watches my<br></p><p><b>00:20:10.100 - 00:20:11.966</b><br>videos has a little bit more of<br></p><p><b>00:20:12.166 - 00:20:13.666</b><br>a bigger picture view<br></p><p><b>00:20:14.133 - 00:20:15.533</b><br>so you can kind of<br></p><p><b>00:20:15.700 - 00:20:17.666</b><br>gauge your trades that way and<br></p><p><b>00:20:17.766 - 00:20:20.300</b><br>understand anyway why I am still continuing to sell<br></p><p><b>00:20:23.166 - 00:20:23.500</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:20:23.500 - 00:20:25.466</b><br>hopefully we get some kind of correction soon<br></p><p><b>00:20:25.466 - 00:20:27.200</b><br>but it does look really strong<br></p><p><b>00:20:27.200 - 00:20:28.966</b><br>and it could easily go<br></p><p><b>00:20:29.300 - 00:20:32.733</b><br>6,000 7,000 8,000 who knows<br></p></body></html>
