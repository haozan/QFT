00:00:05.900</b><br>daytrating for a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.733 - 00:00:09.500</b><br>there's a lot of discussions lately in Slack<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.933 - 00:00:12.966</b><br>and in the discord rooms of day trading<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.300 - 00:00:15.200</b><br>which I don't recommend obviously<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.666 - 00:00:17.800</b><br>especially when you have charts as beautiful as like<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.800 - 00:00:19.600</b><br>look at this Bitcoin chart<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.166 - 00:00:21.866</b><br>you can so easily<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.666 - 00:00:26.600</b><br>position trade this and never ever lose any money<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.533 - 00:00:29.466</b><br>but then if you start day trading it<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.800 - 00:00:31.900</b><br>what you're doing is you're leveraging money<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.366 - 00:00:34.366</b><br>you're leveraging your money<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.133 - 00:00:36.533</b><br>so you're trying to get<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.533 - 00:00:41.266</b><br>1% or 2% or 3% on a trade using bigger money<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.266 - 00:00:43.400</b><br>otherwise it's not even worth your time right<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.666 - 00:00:44.800</b><br>if you're only going to make<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.300 - 00:00:47.766</b><br>2 bucks 10 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.900 - 00:00:50.600</b><br>15 bucks it's almost not worth your time<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.600 - 00:00:55.000</b><br>so you have to go in with a large size<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.500 - 00:00:57.300</b><br>to be able to make 50 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.300 - 00:00:59.466</b><br>you know on your trade or $100 in your trade<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.500 - 00:01:00.200</b><br>and you're thinking<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.200 - 00:01:01.866</b><br>oh well I'm gonna be able to do that all day<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.866 - 00:01:03.366</b><br>you know just in and out in and out<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.366 - 00:01:05.366</b><br>50 bucks 50 bucks 30 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.866 - 00:01:06.966</b><br>doesn't really work out<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.666 - 00:01:09.200</b><br>and then you get big swings<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.200 - 00:01:11.400</b><br>and what do you do when those big swings come<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.400 - 00:01:12.366</b><br>they will come<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.733 - 00:01:14.900</b><br>you know for days<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.900 - 00:01:16.400</b><br>you might be able to make these little<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.400 - 00:01:19.066</b><br>3 percents and 2% trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.066 - 00:01:22.000</b><br>and then all of a sudden this happens right here<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.066 - 00:01:26.600</b><br>you know this big massive drop and you're in huge<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.100 - 00:01:28.566</b><br>right in front of this big<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.566 - 00:01:30.300</b><br>massive drop and you're forced<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.300 - 00:01:32.366</b><br>almost forced into taking a loss<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.366 - 00:01:34.766</b><br>at some point the pain gets too big<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.100 - 00:01:36.466</b><br>and you probably<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.466 - 00:01:38.366</b><br>take a loss figuring you're going to be able to day<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.366 - 00:01:39.866</b><br>trade and make up make it up<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.933 - 00:01:45.400</b><br>okay so I just changed just to 15 minute candles<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.300 - 00:01:47.966</b><br>I don't think you want to go any lower than 15<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.966 - 00:01:48.800</b><br>minute candles<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.800 - 00:01:49.600</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.933 - 00:01:52.466</b><br>5 minute candles are gonna be almost impossible to read<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.166 - 00:01:54.600</b><br>in this type of environment<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.733 - 00:01:56.900</b><br>you're gonna find that even with bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.900 - 00:02:00.000</b><br>even though it's the highest volume coin we have<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.933 - 00:02:01.300</b><br>yeah<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.300 - 00:02:03.800</b><br>those bases are still gonna be really hard to predict<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.966 - 00:02:05.866</b><br>because it's still not liquid enough<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.200 - 00:02:06.933</b><br>even<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.933 - 00:02:10.366</b><br>though it's the most liquid coin we have day trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.366 - 00:02:11.166</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.500 - 00:02:14.533</b><br>okay it's going to be even hard for me to call<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.533 - 00:02:15.366</b><br>bases on this<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.366 - 00:02:17.933</b><br>so if you were on a 15 minute chart<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.966 - 00:02:21.500</b><br>if you look into the past you can kind of<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.500 - 00:02:23.533</b><br>guess bases like you'd be able to say okay<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.533 - 00:02:24.933</b><br>look here was a base<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.100 - 00:02:27.800</b><br>and here would be the spot where I think of buying<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.800 - 00:02:29.100</b><br>there's my bounce<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.366 - 00:02:30.266</b><br>here's the base<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.266 - 00:02:32.400</b><br>probably didn't buy this little bit of nothing<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.866 - 00:02:34.700</b><br>and then you get this long run up<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.700 - 00:02:35.600</b><br>so this is<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.600 - 00:02:38.333</b><br>obviously into the future would be a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.800 - 00:02:41.966</b><br>so right here you call this a base it never dropped it<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.166 - 00:02:44.666</b><br>you'd call that a base and okay<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.700 - 00:02:47.133</b><br>maybe you'd buy this and sell there<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.400 - 00:02:49.100</b><br>you know and what are you making like<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.500 - 00:02:50.533</b><br>on 11<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.466 - 00:02:53.866</b><br>164 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.066 - 00:02:55.266</b><br>you'd be making like<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.366 - 00:02:57.200</b><br>15 20 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.900 - 00:03:00.766</b><br>you know you may be maybe 30 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.266 - 00:03:03.600</b><br>on 11 thousand dollars<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.600 - 00:03:06.366</b><br>that's the kind of percentages you're looking at here<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.300 - 00:03:10.100</b><br>okay so let me just switch back to scroller<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.266 - 00:03:12.300</b><br>so since we're in the past now<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.333 - 00:03:14.366</b><br>we're looking at April the second<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.800 - 00:03:16.900</b><br>there's no particular reason I picked the people<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.900 - 00:03:17.133</b><br>a second<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.133 - 00:03:19.533</b><br>I just went to where there was no more chart left<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.800 - 00:03:20.600</b><br>you know where<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.166 - 00:03:25.966</b><br>Trading View wouldn't give me a chart anymore okay so<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.966 - 00:03:27.666</b><br>now we can't see the future<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.100 - 00:03:29.300</b><br>so now you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.300 - 00:03:31.533</b><br>you might have drawn your base right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.200 - 00:03:33.200</b><br>you go draw it<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.266 - 00:03:35.200</b><br>you might draw your little base right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.133 - 00:03:38.366</b><br>mind you just remember that this is not<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.566 - 00:03:40.100</b><br>the type of thing that I would do<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.100 - 00:03:40.800</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.800 - 00:03:42.900</b><br>you draw your base right there and you're waiting for<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.900 - 00:03:43.600</b><br>something to happen<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.600 - 00:03:44.566</b><br>okay goes out<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.200 - 00:03:47.500</b><br>maybe you're going to start to draw a base over here<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.400 - 00:03:50.300</b><br>so I have to keep switching back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.300 - 00:03:51.733</b><br>you might draw a little base right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.733 - 00:03:53.700</b><br>because you got a little bit of bounce off of that<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.466 - 00:03:57.533</b><br>goes up again<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.366 - 00:03:59.133</b><br>okay well here<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.133 - 00:04:01.333</b><br>looks like you could draw a little bass right there<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.600 - 00:04:05.266</b><br>now keep in mind that although your day trading<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.266 - 00:04:07.933</b><br>oh whoops I totally picked the wrong tool<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.400 - 00:04:13.066</b><br>so bear in mind that even though your day trading<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.200 - 00:04:15.566</b><br>look how long it took you to find a trade here<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.700 - 00:04:17.500</b><br>you know we're looking at like<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.000 - 00:04:19.300</b><br>that's a full day<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.366 - 00:04:22.066</b><br>from here to there is a full day and here's another day<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.066 - 00:04:24.366</b><br>you've just gone two days without finding a trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.466 - 00:04:27.466</b><br>so I mean if you're<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.200 - 00:04:29.700</b><br>if you're going<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.700 - 00:04:31.333</b><br>two days without finding a trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.333 - 00:04:32.333</b><br>you're probably going to start<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.333 - 00:04:34.933</b><br>thinking about making this 5 minute charts<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.933 - 00:04:36.933</b><br>which is going to be insane<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.200 - 00:04:39.200</b><br>okay anyway let's continue sorry<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.266 - 00:04:40.700</b><br>I got to go back to scrolling<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.566 - 00:04:42.800</b><br>so we keep going here<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.800 - 00:04:44.166</b><br>we found ourselves a little base<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.166 - 00:04:46.733</b><br>now maybe we're going to call this a base right here<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.400 - 00:04:49.466</b><br>so you go and call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.866 - 00:04:52.400</b><br>and then you get a base crack<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.400 - 00:04:54.600</b><br>and you're probably going to end up lying in here<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.933 - 00:04:55.600</b><br>or in here<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.600 - 00:04:58.000</b><br>it's the best base crack you've gotten in a long time<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.000 - 00:04:58.800</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.533 - 00:05:01.500</b><br>and that's the scrolling<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.400 - 00:05:05.500</b><br>and you get a little bounce and see right here<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.733 - 00:05:09.733</b><br>you see you see this is 15 minutes each candle<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.733 - 00:05:10.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.333 - 00:05:12.300</b><br>you're looking at about three hours here<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.533 - 00:05:15.100</b><br>so let's say you got in here and you got in here<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.333 - 00:05:18.933</b><br>three hours go by and you're still<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.933 - 00:05:20.400</b><br>you're still not even breaking even<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.400 - 00:05:22.266</b><br>you're still looking at this thing thinking<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.500 - 00:05:25.566</b><br>hmm I wonder if I should just take a loss on this<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.566 - 00:05:26.533</b><br>you know like you're<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.533 - 00:05:27.933</b><br>you're looking at let's say you put<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.966 - 00:05:29.733</b><br>11 thousand dollars in<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.166 - 00:05:31.266</b><br>you're looking at like<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.533 - 00:05:34.266</b><br>I don't know like a 670 dollar loss<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.533 - 00:05:35.400</b><br>so you're like ah<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.400 - 00:05:37.733</b><br>maybe I should take a lawsuit here I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.733 - 00:05:39.066</b><br>and this is the point<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.666 - 00:05:44.500</b><br>where one little mistake can really mess you up royally<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.866 - 00:05:46.500</b><br>just kill your account<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.733 - 00:05:50.800</b><br>because you're in with over 11 thousand dollars<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.866 - 00:05:52.900</b><br>trying to make 50 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.333 -

00:07:42.766</b><br>anyway so here<br></p><p><b>00:07:43.133 - 00:07:45.133</b><br>by this point you're now down<br></p><p><b>00:07:45.200 - 00:07:49.066</b><br>$1,000 you know you're at 10,900<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.266 -

00:08:12.466</b><br>it actually takes you down to 10,800<br></p><p><b>00:08:12.466 - 00:08:15.366</b><br>and you get this little bounce back up to<br></p><p><b>00:08:15.666 - 00:08:19.566</b><br>10,000 9 9 like to 11 thousand almost<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.566 - 00:08:22.166</b><br>which was almost what you were calling your real base<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.166 - 00:08:23.266</b><br>if you had looked at<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.266 - 00:08:24.800</b><br>a bigger chart okay<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.800 - 00:08:25.666</b><br>I just cleared the screen<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.666 - 00:08:27.766</b><br>so that we could draw this base a little clearer<br></p><p><b>00:08:28.066 - 00:08:30.166</b><br>than what I had so let's say this was the ball<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.166 - 00:08:31.700</b><br>let's say this was the base<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.866 - 00:08:33.933</b><br>which is nice it's pretty well 1100<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.400 - 00:08:36.400</b><br>if I can just keep my mouse going straight<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.366 - 00:08:38.366</b><br>you'll see that<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.566 - 00:08:41.800</b><br>this actually bounced if this was the base crack<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.800 - 00:08:43.800</b><br>and you were buying anywhere in here<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.266 - 00:08:46.966</b><br>this actually bounced right back up to almost 1100<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.966 - 00:08:50.000</b><br>or maybe just slightly over 1100<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.466 - 00:08:51.966</b><br>to give you that beautiful bounce<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.966 -

00:09:06.500</b><br>this was your mistake right there<br></p><p><b>00:09:06.533 - 00:09:08.400</b><br>and what was this mistake<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.000 - 00:09:10.900</b><br>well the mistake was<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.333 - 00:09:13.966</b><br>that you're basing this trade off of that<br></p><p><b>00:09:13.966 - 00:09:15.400</b><br>little tiny bounce<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.466 - 00:09:16.933</b><br>calling this a base<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.266 - 00:09:18.666</b><br>and you almost have to do that<br></p><p><b>00:09:18.666 - 00:09:20.533</b><br>because you're trading in such<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.700 - 00:09:22.066</b><br>small percentages<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.066 -

00:09:32.500</b><br>was this a base yes because you had a big long bounce<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.333 - 00:09:35.966</b><br>anyway now you're back down here<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.300 - 00:09:38.566</b><br>and you can start trying to<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.933 - 00:09:40.933</b><br>trying to fix yourself by calling bases<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.266 - 00:09:42.666</b><br>and buying in<br></p><p><b>00:09:42.666 - 00:09:45.166</b><br>and calling bases and buying in but you're already<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.533 - 00:09:48.333</b><br>you already have your money engaged because you already<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.333 - 00:09:49.133</b><br>engaged<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.166 - 00:09:50.766</b><br>11 thousand dollars up here<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.400 - 00:09:55.900</b><br>so now at this point you are truly $1,000 down<br></p><p><b>00:09:56.066 - 00:09:58.100</b><br>and the past three or four<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.100 - 00:10:00.166</b><br>days or five days or however long<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.333 -

00:10:10.466</b><br>I don't want to make this video for<br></p><p><b>00:10:10.533 - 00:10:11.400</b><br>Keep Going Forever here<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.400 - 00:10:13.533</b><br>let me move my screen that little facer<br></p><p><b>00:10:14.366 -

00:11:00.366</b><br>example<br></p><p><b>00:11:00.366 - 00:11:01.666</b><br>you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:11:02.733 - 00:11:06.200</b><br>you know as this gets further and further in the hole<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.366 -
