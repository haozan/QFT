00:00:05.166</b><br>that I have the new<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.166 - 00:00:07.166</b><br>scanner that we're going to be using<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.666 - 00:00:10.100</b><br>that's that I'm going to provide a link for<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.466 - 00:00:11.666</b><br>down below this video<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.366 - 00:00:13.800</b><br>for everybody to start using today<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.266 - 00:00:16.566</b><br>the cryptomarket scanner and it's being<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.966 - 00:00:18.366</b><br>sent to us on Telegram<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.000 - 00:00:22.200</b><br>so before we get to that let's just discuss really<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.200 - 00:00:23.000</b><br>quick<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.600 - 00:00:26.166</b><br>why we need a scanner and what it can do for us<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.866 - 00:00:27.866</b><br>I'm going to be taking the day off<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.866 - 00:00:31.100</b><br>so this is early morning on Wednesday and I'm<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.100 - 00:00:32.333</b><br>just making this video<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.133 - 00:00:33.766</b><br>quickly<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.766 - 00:00:36.566</b><br>before I take the day off and go spend it with my wife<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.100 - 00:00:38.533</b><br>my wife has the day off so<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.000 - 00:00:41.100</b><br>but I just wanted everybody to get this scanner ahead<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.100 - 00:00:42.700</b><br>but I also want to kind of<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.733 - 00:00:45.733</b><br>give you some ideas like a warning<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.900 - 00:00:47.900</b><br>on what not to do with it and<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.133 - 00:00:52.166</b><br>I don't want everybody taking day trading positions<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.566 - 00:00:55.466</b><br>when they are not too familiar with day training so<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.466 - 00:00:58.366</b><br>please keep your position small when you're starting<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.200 - 00:01:03.333</b><br>and there's three things that a scanner can do for us<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.500 - 00:01:06.166</b><br>so basically a scanner will tell you when<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.366 - 00:01:07.466</b><br>this scanner in particular<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.466 - 00:01:09.066</b><br>will tell you when there's a drop of<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.266 - 00:01:11.500</b><br>of 10% within a five minute period<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.666 - 00:01:13.333</b><br>and it alerts you<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.533 - 00:01:14.333</b><br>when<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.700 - 00:01:16.200</b><br>that low is hit<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.500 - 00:01:17.800</b><br>so when it hits<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.300 - 00:01:20.300</b><br>less than or more than<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.900 - 00:01:22.766</b><br>10% within five minutes<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.066 - 00:01:25.366</b><br>so you looking at the scanner rate here<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.933 - 00:01:27.533</b><br>you'll see that it says<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.600 - 00:01:29.300</b><br>this DTC dropped<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.333 - 00:01:32.000</b><br>12 percent within the last five minutes<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.133 - 00:01:35.500</b><br>and then HMQ which just just got alerted<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.100 - 00:01:38.066</b><br>drop 10% and so on so forth<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.066 - 00:01:39.866</b><br>and if you scroll up you're going to get some big ones<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.866 - 00:01:40.800</b><br>sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.700 - 00:01:43.000</b><br>there's 22 percent<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.500 - 00:01:44.300</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.300 - 00:01:48.400</b><br>24 percent I know there's like a 40<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.600 - 00:01:51.300</b><br>right here 41 percent which I got this one<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.400 - 00:01:52.966</b><br>so I'll show you that trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.900 - 00:01:56.566</b><br>but anyway it's going to tell you<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.566 - 00:01:59.000</b><br>anything over 10% within the past five minutes<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.000 - 00:02:01.366</b><br>and there's three trades<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.766 - 00:02:02.566</b><br>three different<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.933 - 00:02:04.866</b><br>uses for that so one<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.066 - 00:02:06.866</b><br>would be a big dip<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.866 - 00:02:08.933</b><br>right when something dips really fast<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.933 - 00:02:11.400</b><br>really hard and an example of that<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.266 - 00:02:14.066</b><br>would be<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.333 - 00:02:16.566</b><br>I just saw one<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.966 - 00:02:18.133</b><br>that was really nice<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.566 - 00:02:21.533</b><br>it was an EOS1<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.166 - 00:02:28.166</b><br>right here look at EOS 75 %<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.766 - 00:02:29.966</b><br>so that's pretty big right<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.966 - 00:02:31.500</b><br>you want to be alerted for that<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.966 - 00:02:33.766</b><br>it's on the liquid exchange<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.000 - 00:02:35.333</b><br>the Liqui<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.533 - 00:02:36.733</b><br>exchange I call it liquid<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.600 - 00:02:40.466</b><br>so right now we're only scanning<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.466 - 00:02:41.266</b><br>if<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.300 - 00:02:43.366</b><br>you go to<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.800 - 00:02:45.100</b><br>Viewchannel Info<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.566 - 00:02:47.566</b><br>you'll see that we're scanning Vitrex<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.733 - 00:02:49.866</b><br>Liqui and Hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.300 - 00:02:52.266</b><br>so those are the three exchanges that we're scanning<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.266 - 00:02:55.200</b><br>you'll add more exchanges as time goes<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.700 - 00:02:56.800</b><br>but those are the three<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.933 - 00:02:59.733</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.900 - 00:03:06.466</b><br>and this would be an example of those crazy dips<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.466 - 00:03:07.533</b><br>and so let me just<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.533 - 00:03:09.566</b><br>explain to you what's happening on this one<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.733 - 00:03:14.733</b><br>the way that he made this scanner is we can just link<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.733 - 00:03:15.900</b><br>directly to our<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.066 - 00:03:18.600</b><br>Kanegi account so if you click on this link<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.900 - 00:03:21.366</b><br>it just pops up the chart you don't have to do anything<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.366 - 00:03:23.700</b><br>it's right there and you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.200 - 00:03:26.933</b><br>this thing has been spiking down to<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.333 - 00:03:30.100</b><br>point 0019<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.466 - 00:03:33.733</b><br>it's been spiking down from 77 to that<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.766 - 00:03:36.900</b><br>and look how many spikes are already this morning so<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.200 - 00:03:38.500</b><br>basically what<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.166 - 00:03:40.133</b><br>what you should do<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.133 - 00:03:42.666</b><br>the procedure you should take every time that you<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.666 - 00:03:43.900</b><br>pop up one of these<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.366 - 00:03:46.933</b><br>results in the market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.200 - 00:03:49.533</b><br>when you look at a chart you got to start with<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.300 - 00:03:51.133</b><br>a month<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.366 - 00:03:53.733</b><br>take a look at a whole month at least<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.800 - 00:03:55.666</b><br>of data on a one hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.700 - 00:03:57.900</b><br>and then dial it down to<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.900 - 00:03:59.666</b><br>a 10 minute or a five minute chart<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.666 - 00:04:01.100</b><br>because you're daytreating<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.300 - 00:04:02.133</b><br>so right here<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.133 - 00:04:04.766</b><br>this would be position trading type of chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.766 - 00:04:05.966</b><br>and you just want to see<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.966 - 00:04:07.533</b><br>you want to get a feel for what<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.266 - 00:04:08.866</b><br>the<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.866 - 00:04:10.066</b><br>coin is doing<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.300 - 00:04:12.866</b><br>and then you want to dial it down to what's happening<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.866 - 00:04:14.100</b><br>right now so<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.100 - 00:04:18.166</b><br>you can see that for a while now it's been basing at 77<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.366 - 00:04:20.566</b><br>and there's all these nice little pops<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.166 - 00:04:24.100</b><br>if I move it over so that we can get rid of<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.900 - 00:04:27.066</b><br>we can get rid of what just just happened<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.700 - 00:04:30.266</b><br>you can see that the chart really does react well<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.400 - 00:04:33.333</b><br>you know it's EOS right so we all know<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.733 - 00:04:34.966</b><br>what that coin is all about<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.200 - 00:04:38.566</b><br>but you can see that you know bases are respected<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.000 - 00:04:40.500</b><br>things are like when<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.500 - 00:04:42.200</b><br>a base cracks it pops back up<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.200 - 00:04:44.166</b><br>when a base cracks it pops back up<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.966 - 00:04:46.300</b><br>so it is a good chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.400 - 00:04:48.266</b><br>it's a pretty good chart just on its own<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.133 - 00:04:50.966</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.766 - 00:04:54.100</b><br>let me move this over so now we got all these spikes<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.100 - 00:04:55.900</b><br>so you take it down to a five minute<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.900 - 00:04:57.900</b><br>and you'll see<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.966 - 00:04:58.766</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.866 - 00:05:02.600</b><br>wow huge massive spikes down to 19<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.600 - 00:05:04.133</b><br>which means somebody big<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.466 - 00:05:05.266</b><br>is<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.533 - 00:05:06.700</b><br>try and get rid of their position<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.700 - 00:05:09.366</b><br>but they're doing it in little spurts right<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.766 - 00:05:12.700</b><br>and what happens is the book is too thin<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.933 - 00:05:14.400</b><br>on this exchange<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.533 - 00:05:15.333</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.500 - 00:05:18.133</b><br>this big person who's trying to get rid of their stuff<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.400 - 00:05:21.100</b><br>they let the bit grow<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.100 - 00:05:22.866</b><br>like they let people add to the bit<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.866 - 00:05:24.300</b><br>and then they whack the bit<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.100 - 00:05:26.666</b><br>and then they eat the whole<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.100 - 00:05:28.866</b><br>bunch of them all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.933 - 00:05:31.600</b><br>wherever there's some major support at the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.666 - 00:05:33.600</b><br>so if you look you'll see this<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.600 - 00:05:36.200</b><br>evident on level 2 and you'll see this on<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.933 - 00:05:38.966</b><br>time and sales<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.100 - 00:05:41.100</b><br>so on level 2 you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.533 - 00:05:43.066</b><br>all the way like<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.333 -

00:09:52.566</b><br>and I caught one of these last night so<br></p><p><b>00:09:52.866 - 00:09:54.266</b><br>let's just take a look at that<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.000 - 00:09:56.766</b><br>so if we go back to the Market Scanner<br></p><p><b>00:09:57.266 - 00:09:59.400</b><br>and we I caught<br></p><p><b>00:09:59.700 - 00:10:03.533</b><br>pitoy so pitoy we go back a little piece here<br></p><p><b>00:10:04.666 - 00:10:06.400</b><br>I caught this one so pitoy<br></p><p><b>00:10:06.466 - 00:10:08.100</b><br>41 percent drop<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.800 - 00:10:10.900</b><br>so if we just click on that you'll see my<br></p><p><b>00:10:13.466 - 00:10:14.766</b><br>you'll see my buys<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.366 - 00:10:17.100</b><br>you'll see that it had one of those big<br></p><p><b>00:10:17.100 - 00:10:19.300</b><br>huge drops just like we were talking about<br></p><p><b>00:10:20.000 - 00:10:21.666</b><br>which lasted a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:10:21.766 - 00:10:23.000</b><br>and I got<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.133 - 00:10:28.666</b><br>you know 40's and I got 30's and then I just sold 54's<br></p><p><b>00:10:29.200 - 00:10:31.133</b><br>so you can see big percentages<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.666 - 00:10:33.166</b><br>just for watching the scanner<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.166 - 00:10:36.500</b><br>so that's the very first type of tray that you can take<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.500 - 00:10:37.466</b><br>off the scanner<br></p><p><b>00:10:37.466 - 00:10:38.733</b><br>and if<br></p><p><b>00:10:38.766 - 00:10:40.966</b><br>another thing that you want to think about is okay<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.066 - 00:10:43.266</b><br>is this a drop<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.266 - 00:10:43.900</b><br>is this<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.900 - 00:10:44.900</b><br>a flash<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.533 - 00:10:47.300</b><br>a spike down or<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.533 - 00:10:48.966</b><br>is this because of something<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.966 - 00:10:50.733</b><br>and usually volume will tell you<br></p><p><b>00:10:50.733 - 00:10:52.266</b><br>but another way to look at this<br></p><p><b>00:10:52.400 - 00:10:52.766</b><br>would be<br></p><p><b>00:10:52.766 - 00:10:56.366</b><br>this is on the Vitrex exchange that I got this ptoi<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.600 - 00:10:58.900</b><br>well really quickly all you have to do<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.066 - 00:11:01.966</b><br>is pick another exchange like<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.200 - 00:11:07.933</b><br>Poloniacs<br></p><p><b>00:11:09.400 - 00:11:11.066</b><br>I don't know which one I have it on<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.366 - 00:11:13.300</b><br>oh Cryptopia yeah<br></p><p><b>00:11:13.666 - 00:11:14.466</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:11:15.366 - 00:11:16.166</b><br>fitoi<br></p><p><b>00:11:16.200 - 00:11:17.466</b><br>no I don't have it there either<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.466 - 00:11:18.766</b><br>let me pause it a thing for<br></p><p><b>00:11:19.533 - 00:11:22.066</b><br>yeah sorry so yeah on the liquid exchange<br></p><p><b>00:11:22.066 - 00:11:23.766</b><br>you can get this exact same chart<br></p><p><b>00:11:23.766 - 00:11:26.100</b><br>so here's the chart that we were looking on Vitrex<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.333 - 00:11:26.933</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.933 - 00:11:29.466</b><br>where pitoy took this major dive and you know<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.466 - 00:11:31.400</b><br>well I know that that's just because<br></p><p><b>00:11:31.400 - 00:11:33.666</b><br>somebody big was trying to sell their position in a<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.666 - 00:11:34.733</b><br>thin book<br></p><p><b>00:11:35.666 - 00:11:38.800</b><br>so now if you go to pitoy on liquid exchange<br></p><p><b>00:11:39.366 - 00:11:40.533</b><br>you'll see that<br></p><p><b>00:11:41.066 - 00:11:42.733</b><br>that never happened right<br></p><p><b>00:11:42.733 - 00:11:45.866</b><br>it's still at 54 exactly where it is on the other one<br></p><p><b>00:11:46.133 - 00:11:49.766</b><br>on Vitrex there's just no spike down because<br></p><p><b>00:11:50.133 - 00:11:51.933</b><br>the book is thicker and<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.933 - 00:11:53.733</b><br>there's nobody trying to get out of their position<br></p><p><b>00:11:53.733 - 00:11:56.266</b><br>so it's not like somebody just whacked<br></p><p><b>00:11:56.366 - 00:11:57.533</b><br>a really thick book<br></p><p><b>00:11:57.533 - 00:11:58.700</b><br>a really thin book<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.166 - 00:12:02.700</b><br>so those type of alerts are available<br></p><p><b>00:12:03.066 - 00:12:04.933</b><br>let's try to go find Pito again<br></p><p><b>00:12:06.366 - 00:12:08.400</b><br>these kind of alerts are available<br></p><p><b>00:12:09.100 -

00:12:20.200</b><br>this is what I call a fat finger trade<br></p><p><b>00:12:20.366 - 00:12:21.266</b><br>this is where<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.000 - 00:12:24.200</b><br>somebody big is trying to get out of a position<br></p><p><b>00:12:24.266 -

00:12:31.533</b><br>they will it will<br></p><p><b>00:12:31.666 - 00:12:33.600</b><br>be sitting at the bottom for a little while<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.600 - 00:12:35.933</b><br>like maybe a few minutes and give us a chance to<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.266 - 00:12:38.100</b><br>get in or at least put orders<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.200 - 00:12:39.566</b><br>around where it drops you<br></p><p><b>00:12:39.733 - 00:12:41.933</b><br>the other situation is<br></p><p><b>00:12:42.400 - 00:12:43.933</b><br>you know like a more experienced<br></p><p><b>00:12:43.933 - 00:12:46.300</b><br>traitor who's still trying to get rid of his coins<br></p><p><b>00:12:46.466 - 00:12:49.266</b><br>but what he's doing is letting the bid grow<br></p><p><b>00:12:49.266 - 00:12:50.733</b><br>so that he can whack it again<br></p><p><b>00:12:51.566 - 00:12:54.133</b><br>and that's what's happening over there on EOS<br></p><p><b>00:12:54.133 - 00:12:54.933</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:12:54.933 - 00:12:55.566</b><br>just<br></p><p><b>00:12:55.566 - 00:12:58.100</b><br>to be able to find these type of trades<br></p><p><b>00:12:58.600 - 00:13:01.133</b><br>is one really good reason for the market scan<br></p><p><b>00:13:01.533 - 00:13:03.066</b><br>so the next reason<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.133 - 00:13:06.366</b><br>the next thing that a market scanner can give us is<br></p><p><b>00:13:07.966 - 00:13:09.300</b><br>finding those income<br></p><p><b>00:13:09.333 -

00:13:19.166</b><br>we'll see any on this market scanner but let's just<br></p><p><b>00:13:19.366 - 00:13:20.933</b><br>scroll down to the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:13:22.700 - 00:13:25.533</b><br>so let's just click on these and see what happens<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.300 - 00:13:29.100</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:13:29.533 - 00:13:32.600</b><br>that is the type of chart you're looking for something<br></p><p><b>00:13:32.600 - 00:13:35.900</b><br>that bounces high percentages back and forth but<br></p><p><b>00:13:36.266 - 00:13:37.400</b><br>that's not quite what I want<br></p><p><b>00:13:38.700 - 00:13:41.100</b><br>let's see what's next on the market scanner here<br></p><p><b>00:13:46.933 - 00:13:48.900</b><br>so this is a good example<br></p><p><b>00:13:48.900 - 00:13:49.700</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:13:50.400 - 00:13:53.333</b><br>again where things are bouncing from<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.200 - 00:13:59.733</b><br>6 all the way up to 9 and 6 all the way up to 9 and<br></p><p><b>00:14:00.500 - 00:14:01.100</b><br></p><p><b>00:14:01.100 - 00:14:02.366</b><br>all the way up to 8<br></p><p><b>00:14:02.466 - 00:14:06.066</b><br>and right now we can pick it up at 5<br></p><p><b>00:14:06.133 - 00:14:07.866</b><br>like all the way down here at 5<br></p><p><b>00:14:10.600 - 00:14:12.333</b><br>you know the scanner has<br></p><p><b>00:14:12.666 - 00:14:14.933</b><br>would have given us this alert maybe even a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:14:14.933 - 00:14:16.600</b><br>earlier when we got another drop<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.700 - 00:14:17.500</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:14:17.766 - 00:14:20.066</b><br>we might have been able to if I hadn't<br></p><p><b>00:14:20.066 - 00:14:22.566</b><br>like we just went back in the past of the scanner<br></p><p><b>00:14:22.866 - 00:14:26.700</b><br>but if we had gotten this alert when it first came out<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.200 - 00:14:29.300</b><br>we might have been able to get those four fives<br></p><p><b>00:14:29.300 - 00:14:29.866</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:14:29.866 - 00:14:31.500</b><br>so basically you're looking at<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.966 - 00:14:33.500</b><br>an account building chart<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.600 - 00:14:37.066</b><br>a chart that gives you really high percentages<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.500 - 00:14:40.300</b><br>and because the scanner is set up to alert us<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.366 - 00:14:43.733</b><br>any time there's a drop of more than 10%<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.900 - 00:14:46.266</b><br>you'll get a lot of these<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.266 - 00:14:48.000</b><br>a lot of these account builder<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.700 - 00:14:52.166</b><br>type things where you can only take small trades but<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.000 - 00:14:55.733</b><br>you can make two three 400 dollars a trade<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.200 - 00:14:58.933</b><br>but it really builds a small account very fast<br></p><p><b>00:14:58.933 - 00:15:00.300</b><br>and if you're trying to find<br></p><p><b>00:15:00.300 - 00:15:02.566</b><br>those type of small account builder<br></p><p><b>00:15:03.533 - 00:15:05.533</b><br>things then that's wonderful for<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.333 - 00:15:08.300</b><br>having the scanner<br></p><p><b>00:15:08.700 - 00:15:12.333</b><br>and then the next the last type of trade that<br></p><p><b>00:15:13.100 - 00:15:15.400</b><br>this scanner will give us are<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.400 - 00:15:20.000</b><br>coins that are taking off on high volume and<br></p><p><b>00:15:20.000 - 00:15:21.466</b><br>having a quick pullback<br></p><p><b>00:15:21.566 - 00:15:23.266</b><br>so something where<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.800 - 00:15:25.366</b><br>and I don't think we're going to find<br></p><p><b>00:15:25.366 - 00:15:27.133</b><br>an example this morning of that<br></p><p><b>00:15:28.300 - 00:15:29.800</b><br>but I can pause the video for a second<br></p><p><b>00:15:29.800 - 00:15:31.000</b><br>and see if I can find one<br></p><p><b>00:15:31.000 - 00:15:32.566</b><br>in all of the<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.200 - 00:15:33.733</b><br>the<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.733 - 00:15:37.300</b><br>alerts that happen recently but basically when<br></p><p><b>00:15:37.800 - 00:15:40.900</b><br>a coin just takes off because of news or something<br></p><p><b>00:15:41.266 - 00:15:44.066</b><br>and it gets that first initial push<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.000 - 00:15:48.733</b><br>your safest your safest buy is on the first pull back<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.900 - 00:15:49.700</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:15:49.966 - 00:15:51.400</b><br>let me draw that out for you<br></p><p><b>00:15:51.400 - 00:15:53.000</b><br>just so that it makes sense<br></p><p><b>00:15:53.400 - 00:15:55.300</b><br>so I'll just pause the video for a second<br></p><p><b>00:15:55.766 - 00:15:57.800</b><br>okay so I'm just using paint<br></p><p><b>00:15:58.066 - 00:15:59.733</b><br>just to draw this out for you and<br></p><p><b>00:15:59.733 - 00:16:01.800</b><br>then I'll go and try to see if we can find one<br></p><p><b>00:16:02.400 - 00:16:05.366</b><br>but basically what will happen is you'll be looking at<br></p><p><b>00:16:05.466 - 00:16:07.400</b><br>a one month chart like I always tell you<br></p><p><b>00:16:07.966 - 00:16:08.266</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:16:08.266 - 00:16:10.200</b><br>you're going to have to dial it down to a 10 minute<br></p><p><b>00:16:10.200 - 00:16:11.300</b><br>or a five minute chart<br></p><p><b>00:16:11.300 - 00:16:12.733</b><br>but you start with a one<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.100 - 00:16:15.900</b><br>month chart and to see what is regular<br></p><p><b>00:16:15.900 - 00:16:17.266</b><br>movement for the coin<br></p><p><b>00:16:17.333 - 00:16:19.733</b><br>and what is regular volume for the coin<br></p><p><b>00:16:19.733 - 00:16:20.533</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:16:20.666 - 00:16:23.466</b><br>so you're looking at the volume to see what's normal<br></p><p><b>00:16:23.600 - 00:16:24.400</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:16:24.400 - 00:16:26.066</b><br>you're looking at the movement to see what's normal<br></p><p><b>00:16:26.066 - 00:16:28.166</b><br>and all of a sudden you get this big spike<br></p><p><b>00:16:28.300 - 00:16:31.266</b><br>and understand that this is more of an advanced<br></p><p><b>00:16:31.533 - 00:16:33.266</b><br>day trading type strategy<br></p><p><b>00:16:33.466 - 00:16:36.333</b><br>but what happens is on that first initial spike<br></p><p><b>00:16:36.333 - 00:16:38.700</b><br>when the news just hits or just a few people<br></p><p><b>00:16:38.700 - 00:16:40.200</b><br>have found out about the news<br></p><p><b>00:16:40.800 - 00:16:42.900</b><br>you get this massive spike and of course<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.900 - 00:16:46.333</b><br>huge volume right so you'll get whole bunch of volume<br></p><p><b>00:16:46.466 - 00:16:48.533</b><br>and then off that initial spike<br></p><p><b>00:16:48.533 - 00:16:50.733</b><br>you'll get a drop of 50 percent<br></p><p><b>00:16:51.066 - 00:16:53.100</b><br>this is totally normal stuff<br></p><p><b>00:16:53.533 - 00:16:56.866</b><br>and this is your absolute safest place to buy<br></p><p><b>00:16:57.700 - 00:17:01.300</b><br>you see the volume you see the jump<br></p><p><b>00:17:01.300 - 00:17:03.866</b><br>the bounce I mean the spike up<br></p><p><b>00:17:04.133 - 00:17:06.700</b><br>and then you see a pullback of 50 percent<br></p><p><b>00:17:06.966 - 00:17:08.666</b><br>and this is where I would buy it<br></p><p><b>00:17:08.866 - 00:17:12.133</b><br>now the reason that this is the safest place to buy in<br></p><p><b>00:17:12.200 - 00:17:16.066</b><br>is the very first pullback on a major spike<br></p><p><b>00:17:16.066 - 00:17:17.966</b><br>which could possibly be used<br></p><p><b>00:17:18.466 - 00:17:21.666</b><br>is that when it pulls back 50 percent<br></p><p><b>00:17:21.900 - 00:17:23.000</b><br>what will generally happen<br></p><p><b>00:17:23.000 - 00:17:24.666</b><br>is it you'll take off from there<br></p><p><b>00:17:24.666 - 00:17:27.700</b><br>break the high and just keep going and going and going<br></p><p><b>00:17:27.766 - 00:17:29.866</b><br>and it can go for a long time<br></p><p><b>00:17:30.300 - 00:17:33.400</b><br>that's where you'll get these really big massive moves<br></p><p><b>00:17:33.400 - 00:17:35.933</b><br>and you happen to get in on this very first pull back<br></p><p><b>00:17:35.933 - 00:17:36.733</b><br>it's which you want<br></p><p><b>00:17:37.066 - 00:17:38.566</b><br>but if you're wrong<br></p><p><b>00:17:39.066 - 00:17:40.200</b><br>on the trade<br></p><p><b>00:17:40.366 - 00:17:42.900</b><br>and you bought right here on this pull back<br></p><p><b>00:17:42.900 - 00:17:45.300</b><br>and this was really just one of those spikes that<br></p><p><b>00:17:45.300 - 00:17:46.900</b><br>kind of falls back down<br></p><p><b>00:17:47.066 - 00:17:48.866</b><br>what generally happens<br></p><p><b>00:17:48.966 - 00:17:52.533</b><br>is you'll buying here at the 50% Mark<br></p><p><b>00:17:52.766 - 00:17:55.100</b><br>then the thing will continue lower<br></p><p><b>00:17:55.400 - 00:17:58.600</b><br>it'll dwindle for a few seconds and bounce back to the<br></p><p><b>00:17:58.600 - 00:17:59.866</b><br>50 percent Mark<br></p><p><b>00:18:01.400 - 00:18:02.700</b><br>if it makes its way<br></p><p><b>00:18:02.700 - 00:18:05.133</b><br>all the way back to where it started<br></p><p><b>00:18:05.500 - 00:18:08.066</b><br>then you're just looking to break even on the trade<br></p><p><b>00:18:08.566 - 00:18:09.500</b><br>right so you're<br></p><p><b>00:18:09.500 - 00:18:10.000</b><br>on this<br></p><p><b>00:18:10.000 - 00:18:13.533</b><br>on this first bounce backup this reaction bounce<br></p><p><b>00:18:13.700 - 00:18:15.300</b><br>you're able to get out for free<br></p><p><b>00:18:15.300 - 00:18:17.000</b><br>and it didn't cost you anything<br></p><p><b>00:18:17.300 - 00:18:18.866</b><br>or it cost you very little<br></p><p><b>00:18:18.866 - 00:18:20.366</b><br>maybe you'll get out just right there<br></p><p><b>00:18:20.566 - 00:18:23.000</b><br>so it's a really low risk trade<br></p><p><b>00:18:23.166 - 00:18:26.533</b><br>because you know that you're coming from this peak<br></p><p><b>00:18:26.966 - 00:18:28.533</b><br>all the way back to even<br></p><p><b>00:18:28.866 - 00:18:30.466</b><br>like back to where it started<br></p><p><b>00:18:30.500 - 00:18:31.800</b><br>it will have a reaction<br></p><p><b>00:18:31.800 - 00:18:33.866</b><br>bounce and you will be able to get out<br></p><p><b>00:18:34.100 - 00:18:35.266</b><br>but if you're right<br></p><p><b>00:18:35.566 - 00:18:36.533</b><br>about the trade<br></p><p><b>00:18:36.700 - 00:18:38.066</b><br>then it's just gonna come<br></p><p><b>00:18:38.066 - 00:18:38.566</b><br>it's 50<br></p><p><b>00:18:38.566 - 00:18:39.500</b><br>percent retracement<br></p><p><b>00:18:39.500 -

00:18:49.500</b><br>and you don't lose anything<br></p><p><b>00:18:49.500 - 00:18:52.100</b><br>or you're right and you make a killing right<br></p><p><b>00:18:52.300 - 00:18:53.600</b><br>so so<br></p><p><b>00:18:53.966 - 00:18:58.000</b><br>that's what this scanner can give you as another<br></p><p><b>00:18:58.000 - 00:19:00.066</b><br>type of trait so<br></p><p><b>00:19:00.066 - 00:19:01.800</b><br>we've got over three traits<br></p><p><b>00:19:02.666 -

00:19:26.166</b><br>less likely to be successful<br></p><p><b>00:19:26.266 - 00:19:27.666</b><br>if you take the third pull back<br></p><p><b>00:19:27.666 - 00:19:29.533</b><br>it's less likely to be successful<br></p><p><b>00:19:29.666 -

00:20:17.266</b><br>this is not for our position trading but for day trades<br></p><p><b>00:20:17.266 - 00:20:18.500</b><br>we have three different types of day<br></p><p><b>00:20:18.500 - 00:20:19.600</b><br>trades that we can take<br></p><p><b>00:20:19.966 -

00:20:29.900</b><br>and then more advanced<br></p><p><b>00:20:29.900 - 00:20:31.100</b><br>we'd be able to take the runner<br></p><p><b>00:20:31.100 - 00:20:32.933</b><br>traits of catching those runners<br></p><p><b>00:20:33.066 -

00:20:39.900</b><br>anyway<br></p><p><b>00:20:39.900 - 00:20:41.800</b><br>let's just discuss the scanner for a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:20:41.800 - 00:20:42.666</b><br>before I let you go<br></p><p><b>00:20:43.766 -

00:20:52.733</b><br>when you receive an alert which is going to beep<br></p><p><b>00:20:53.000 - 00:20:54.700</b><br>so it beeps when it alerts<br></p><p><b>00:20:56.333 - 00:20:58.166</b><br>so you're going to see the percentage drop<br></p><p><b>00:20:58.566 - 00:20:59.366</b><br>sorry<br></p><p><b>00:20:59.866 - 00:21:01.000</b><br>my voice just second<br></p><p><b>00:21:02.400 - 00:21:03.000</b><br>making<br></p><p><b>00:21:03.000 - 00:21:05.066</b><br>videos first thing in the morning is not easy on a<br></p><p><b>00:21:05.066 - 00:21:05.866</b><br>voice<br></p><p><b>00:21:06.666 - 00:21:07.466</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:21:08.266 - 00:21:09.766</b><br>you can see the percentage drop right<br></p><p><b>00:21:09.866 - 00:21:11.533</b><br>that's the very first thing you're looking at<br></p><p><b>00:21:12.000 - 00:21:14.133</b><br>on this specific scanner<br></p><p><b>00:21:14.133 - 00:21:16.000</b><br>you're going to see where it dropped from<br></p><p><b>00:21:16.000 - 00:21:17.866</b><br>where it started and where it dropped from<br></p><p><b>00:21:18.166 - 00:21:20.133</b><br>and then you get this beautiful link<br></p><p><b>00:21:20.133 - 00:21:22.366</b><br>that allows you to just call up the chart<br></p><p><b>00:21:23.066 - 00:21:26.500</b><br>so all of that is wonderful that means it's like<br></p><p><b>00:21:26.600 - 00:21:28.766</b><br>oh wow this just drops 26 percent<br></p><p><b>00:21:28.933 - 00:21:32.700</b><br>and one click click and you're already looking<br></p><p><b>00:21:33.466 - 00:21:34.366</b><br>at the data<br></p><p><b>00:21:35.266 - 00:21:36.133</b><br>so that's wonderful<br></p><p><b>00:21:36.133 - 00:21:38.666</b><br>again because you are dealing with day trading<br></p><p><b>00:21:38.766 - 00:21:41.666</b><br>you first take a look at a one month chart<br></p><p><b>00:21:41.666 - 00:21:44.533</b><br>and then you dialed yourself down to a 5 minute chart<br></p><p><b>00:21:44.666 - 00:21:46.866</b><br>to be able to trade within a 5 minute span<br></p><p><b>00:21:47.000 - 00:21:49.266</b><br>and keep all of your positions small<br></p><p><b>00:21:49.266 -

00:21:57.733</b><br>every time there's a new alert<br></p><p><b>00:21:57.733 - 00:22:00.666</b><br>not only will you get a Bing like a like a sound<br></p><p><b>00:22:00.800 - 00:22:02.866</b><br>but you'll also get this little<br></p><p><b>00:22:03.466 - 00:22:05.333</b><br>like if you're looking up and above<br></p><p><b>00:22:05.400 - 00:22:07.000</b><br>you'll get this little thing that allows you to<br></p><p><b>00:22:07.000 - 00:22:08.300</b><br>bring it back to where you<br></p><p><b>00:22:08.300 - 00:22:09.100</b><br>where you are<br></p><p><b>00:22:09.133 - 00:22:11.366</b><br>you'll also get a pop up on your screen<br></p><p><b>00:22:12.266 - 00:22:14.400</b><br>so you know that<br></p><p><b>00:22:15.000 - 00:22:18.066</b><br>Telegram system works pretty good for that<br></p><p><b>00:22:21.500 - 00:22:22.200</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:22:22.200 - 00:22:24.366</b><br>let me see what else can I tell you about this<br></p><p><b>00:22:26.066 - 00:22:28.000</b><br>there's two channels here<br></p><p><b>00:22:28.000 - 00:22:29.600</b><br>I'm going to put a link to both of them<br></p><p><b>00:22:29.733 - 00:22:31.366</b><br>so the one channel is the market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:22:31.366 - 00:22:33.466</b><br>and the second channel is going to be for<br></p><p><b>00:22:34.166 - 00:22:35.533</b><br>news and updates<br></p><p><b>00:22:35.700 - 00:22:36.500</b><br>so the<br></p><p><b>00:22:37.300 - 00:22:40.133</b><br>programmer is going to put his announcements in here<br></p><p><b>00:22:40.400 - 00:22:42.366</b><br>to let us know if he's made some improvements<br></p><p><b>00:22:42.366 - 00:22:44.066</b><br>he's added some exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:22:44.266 - 00:22:45.300</b><br>those type of things<br></p><p><b>00:22:45.566 - 00:22:46.700</b><br>and then if<br></p><p><b>00:22:47.066 - 00:22:50.100</b><br>you find value in this which obviously you will because<br></p><p><b>00:22:50.166 - 00:22:52.466</b><br>it's allowing us to do what humans can't do<br></p><p><b>00:22:52.700 - 00:22:54.400</b><br>it's going and scanning<br></p><p><b>00:22:54.666 - 00:22:56.500</b><br>all of these exchanges and giving us these<br></p><p><b>00:22:56.500 -

00:23:07.333</b><br>view channel info<br></p><p><b>00:23:08.400 - 00:23:10.600</b><br>he linked us to some<br></p><p><b>00:23:10.600 - 00:23:13.733</b><br>like he gave us some addresses that we could donate to<br></p><p><b>00:23:13.733 - 00:23:16.500</b><br>so there's a Bitcoin address in an ether address<br></p><p><b>00:23:16.500 - 00:23:18.800</b><br>and then there's going to be a<br></p><p><b>00:23:20.133 - 00:23:21.366</b><br>I don't see it here<br></p><p><b>00:23:21.966 -

00:23:29.733</b><br>email so that we could make suggestions<br></p><p><b>00:23:29.800 - 00:23:31.466</b><br>so maybe I'll just put that<br></p><p><b>00:23:31.533 - 00:23:32.333</b><br>in<br></p><p><b>00:23:32.700 -

00:23:42.066</b><br>you know a different type of scanner or<br></p><p><b>00:23:42.066 - 00:23:43.200</b><br>if you think of something<br></p><p><b>00:23:43.266 - 00:23:45.366</b><br>else that would improve this scanner for us<br></p><p><b>00:23:45.733 - 00:23:48.200</b><br>so I really appreciate that we have this<br></p><p><b>00:23:48.400 - 00:23:51.266</b><br>and I hope that you guys are excited to use it<br></p><p><b>00:23:52.000 - 00:23:52.966</b><br>but please understand<br></p><p><b>00:23:52.966 - 00:23:55.333</b><br>this has nothing to do with our position trading<br></p><p><b>00:23:56.300 - 00:23:58.300</b><br>position trading is really where the money is<br></p><p><b>00:23:58.766 - 00:24:01.133</b><br>this just gives day trades which<br></p><p><b>00:24:01.300 -

00:24:09.133</b><br>on EOS<br></p><p><b>00:24:09.966 - 00:24:11.000</b><br>where you can just<br></p><p><b>00:24:11.500 - 00:24:12.333</b><br>put yourself<br></p><p><b>00:24:12.333 - 00:24:15.066</b><br>way down and make two and a half times your money<br></p><p><b>00:24:15.600 - 00:24:16.900</b><br>on a trade so<br></p><p><b>00:24:17.000 - 00:24:18.333</b><br>those are ridiculous trades<br></p><p><b>00:24:18.333 - 00:24:21.466</b><br>but they're only available because of a market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:24:23.166 - 00:24:25.466</b><br>here's another quick example of a trait that I got<br></p><p><b>00:24:25.466 - 00:24:26.900</b><br>yesterday off the scanner<br></p><p><b>00:24:27.133 - 00:24:29.066</b><br>just yesterday last night<br></p><p><b>00:24:29.966 -

00:24:42.600</b><br>take this to a five minute<br></p><p><b>00:24:43.466 - 00:24:48.766</b><br>and you can see that I got in at 65 64 and a half<br></p><p><b>00:24:48.800 - 00:24:49.600</b><br>something like that<br></p><p><b>00:24:49.666 -
