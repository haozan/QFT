00:00:07.933</b><br>the happy Steam Trader what is this episode 19<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.933 - 00:00:09.066</b><br>maybe I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.100 - 00:00:11.166</b><br>I'll know when I rate it up and<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.700 - 00:00:13.566</b><br>the title<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.666 - 00:00:14.766</b><br>for today's video<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.766 - 00:00:16.966</b><br>is we're discussing basics a little bit here<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.966 - 00:00:18.066</b><br>we're gonna go over my day<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.133 - 00:00:19.266</b><br>and we're gonna talk about<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.400 - 00:00:21.133</b><br>steam of course like we always do<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.266 - 00:00:24.500</b><br>but just the basics of why do prices move<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.533 - 00:00:25.133</b><br>what<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.133 - 00:00:27.100</b><br>moves prices in the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.366 - 00:00:29.566</b><br>basically the stock market is like a big auction<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.800 - 00:00:32.766</b><br>and if you've ever watched prices right<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.900 - 00:00:34.600</b><br>or if you've ever gone on eBay<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.600 - 00:00:36.400</b><br>you know that when you want to buy something<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.666 - 00:00:37.666</b><br>you bid on it<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.100 - 00:00:40.000</b><br>and so you know you might say<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.000 - 00:00:43.100</b><br>okay I think that watch is worth $10<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.133 - 00:00:48.000</b><br>and then so there's a bid and I drew this little<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.500 - 00:00:49.500</b><br>example for you<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.333 - 00:00:51.966</b><br>right there so you got a bid<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.100 - 00:00:55.900</b><br>sorry so you have a bid and the bid is a list of<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.400 - 00:00:58.066</b><br>people that are willing to buy<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.300 - 00:01:00.533</b><br>so somebody is bidding 10 cents<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.566 - 00:01:02.866</b><br>and they want to buy 5,000 shares<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.933 - 00:01:04.300</b><br>somebody else is bidding<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.500 - 00:01:05.966</b><br>9 cents and they want to buy<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.966 - 00:01:07.600</b><br>20,000 shares and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.600 - 00:01:10.400</b><br>so there's a list here and these guys are all bidding<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.400 - 00:01:12.366</b><br>wishing to buy wanting to own<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.800 - 00:01:15.266</b><br>the stock or in this case<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.333 - 00:01:17.500</b><br>the cryptocurrency<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.533 - 00:01:18.200</b><br>and on the other side<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.200 - 00:01:20.900</b><br>you have a list of everybody who's asking<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.266 - 00:01:22.733</b><br>certain amount for their stock<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.733 - 00:01:24.400</b><br>so these guys are the owners<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.700 - 00:01:26.300</b><br>and this guy's asking<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.333 - 00:01:30.600</b><br>11 cents and he's got 5000 shares to sell<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.100 - 00:01:34.333</b><br>and so on keeps on going down the list so 12 cents<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.333 - 00:01:36.566</b><br>and then 13 cents and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.400 - 00:01:39.400</b><br>so if the price right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.900 - 00:01:41.766</b><br>is at 10 cents let's say<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.466 - 00:01:45.900</b><br>that's the last execution that happened in the market<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.133 - 00:01:48.100</b><br>so in order for that price to move<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.533 - 00:01:51.800</b><br>this guy at 10 cents would have to agree okay<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.000 - 00:01:55.266</b><br>I'm willing to pay 11 and then he comes over<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.666 - 00:01:57.600</b><br>and pays 11 from the ask<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.766 - 00:01:58.566</b><br>or<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.800 - 00:02:00.933</b><br>this guy sitting on the ask who's<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.933 - 00:02:04.166</b><br>willing to sell his shares says alright<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.466 - 00:02:06.400</b><br>I'll let them go for 10 cents<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.400 - 00:02:10.166</b><br>and then he comes and then he sends his order over and<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.300 - 00:02:12.533</b><br>and fills this guy's bit<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.066 - 00:02:16.100</b><br>so that's how it works it's just an auction<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.366 - 00:02:18.000</b><br>and it's just between<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.333 - 00:02:19.766</b><br>the buyers and the sellers<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.766 - 00:02:22.200</b><br>and every time somebody makes a deal<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.800 - 00:02:23.600</b><br>then<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.266 - 00:02:27.000</b><br>an execution happens and the price moves<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.900 - 00:02:29.700</b><br>so that's the basics of how it works<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.266 - 00:02:32.733</b><br>if you have any questions about that<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.766 - 00:02:33.900</b><br>like when we<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.900 - 00:02:36.400</b><br>take a look later on at my traits for the day<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.966 - 00:02:39.533</b><br>I'm going to put notes down here<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.933 - 00:02:40.866</b><br>just a second<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.400 - 00:02:42.766</b><br>yeah so in my notes<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.500 - 00:02:44.966</b><br>I put down that I want to show you<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.966 - 00:02:46.933</b><br>on one of the stocks that I trade today<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.966 - 00:02:51.100</b><br>how I read the volume sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.300 - 00:02:53.366</b><br>what the buyers and the sellers are doing<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.400 - 00:02:56.200</b><br>in order to say oh this is the time to load in<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.300 - 00:02:58.000</b><br>so I'm gonna get to that<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.300 - 00:02:59.600</b><br>first let's take a look at<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.466 - 00:03:01.366</b><br>what we always do<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.366 - 00:03:03.166</b><br>we'll just quickly take a look at steam<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.133 - 00:03:05.733</b><br>I bought a little bit of steam here<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.500 - 00:03:08.966</b><br>and this is one thing that you got to learn<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.966 - 00:03:10.866</b><br>that you got to accept in trading<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.866 - 00:03:12.666</b><br>that sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.766 - 00:03:16.200</b><br>things work out awesome and sometimes things just<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.566 - 00:03:17.066</b><br>don't work out<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.066 - 00:03:18.800</b><br>you just don't get the price you want it<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.900 - 00:03:21.000</b><br>so like in this case right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.800 - 00:03:25.133</b><br>I got it at the bottom right here so you see<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.166 - 00:03:26.566</b><br>I just decided you know what<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.800 - 00:03:30.166</b><br>this steam is basing here I'm gonna buy every dip now<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.400 - 00:03:32.366</b><br>now I'm gonna buy every dip so here's the<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.366 - 00:03:33.566</b><br>here's yesterday's dip<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.566 - 00:03:36.066</b><br>and I managed to get the very bottom<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.066 - 00:03:37.700</b><br>that's you know that's just lucky<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.566 - 00:03:40.600</b><br>and I put my order to sell right<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.700 - 00:03:41.533</b><br>here<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.700 - 00:03:44.300</b><br>right at 275 I think<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.566 - 00:03:45.400</b><br>right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.566 - 00:03:48.466</b><br>and this tip of this thing just didn't quite reach it<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.266 - 00:03:52.100</b><br>so I didn't get to sell so now I'm still in the stock<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.100 - 00:03:54.466</b><br>like well I'm not in it<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.566 - 00:03:56.133</b><br>but I'm in it for real<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.133 - 00:03:57.733</b><br>long term with all these other advice<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.733 - 00:03:59.133</b><br>these are all investments<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.133 - 00:04:00.566</b><br>but now I'm just trying to bounce it around<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.566 - 00:04:02.266</b><br>a little bit with just a little<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.366 - 00:04:04.666</b><br>part of my position and so<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.733 - 00:04:07.000</b><br>I didn't get myself<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.466 - 00:04:10.300</b><br>so now I'm still in to see what happens next<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.966 - 00:04:12.866</b><br>hopefully<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.600 - 00:04:16.100</b><br>this gives me just a little bit of a pop so I can<br></p><p><b>00:04:16.100 - 00:04:18.366</b><br>unload and be ready for the next dip<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.366 - 00:04:21.600</b><br>but anyway that's trading sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.166 - 00:04:23.466</b><br>it's a little punchy like that<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.000 - 00:04:26.733</b><br>okay and then I just want to look at<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.733 - 00:04:28.166</b><br>Ethereum really fast because<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.166 - 00:04:30.333</b><br>Ethereum is doing a strange thing<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.200 - 00:04:32.566</b><br>ethereum is sitting on<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.333 - 00:04:34.733</b><br>that little spot right there<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.733 - 00:04:36.300</b><br>like I showed you the other day<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.300 - 00:04:38.166</b><br>where it looks like it might crack and fall down<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.466 - 00:04:40.933</b><br>and Ethereum Classic is doing the same thing<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.200 - 00:04:43.266</b><br>and it used to be<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.966 - 00:04:45.800</b><br>see the Ethereum Classic just coming down<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.800 - 00:04:47.200</b><br>same way as Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.333 - 00:04:48.466</b><br>is just coming down<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.600 - 00:04:51.466</b><br>it used to be that they did opposites right oh<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.500 - 00:04:53.966</b><br>Ethereum Classic is going to be the greatest thing<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.266 - 00:04:55.666</b><br>and so it's flying high<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.666 - 00:04:56.100</b><br>which means<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.100 - 00:04:58.366</b><br>Ethereum is no good anymore and it's going down<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.666 - 00:05:00.266</b><br>they used to do opposites and now they're not doing<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.266 - 00:05:01.066</b><br>opposites at all<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.966 - 00:05:02.266</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.266 - 00:05:03.800</b><br>so let's look at my trades for the day<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.966 - 00:05:05.733</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.733 - 00:05:08.000</b><br>that steam trade I'll let you know what happens<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.333 - 00:05:10.533</b><br>you know really these are<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.533 - 00:05:11.866</b><br>very small percentages to make<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.866 - 00:05:13.333</b><br>but I just want to balance this because<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.333 - 00:05:16.066</b><br>I don't care if I got stuck with steam<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.200 - 00:05:17.766</b><br>because I want to own steam anyway<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.766 - 00:05:18.933</b><br>so I figured you know what<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.933 - 00:05:20.966</b><br>I transferred a little bit more money to<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.966 - 00:05:22.266</b><br>one of my accounts<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.333 - 00:05:25.533</b><br>that I trade steam in and I'm just going to start<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.500 - 00:05:28.933</b><br>grabbing steam whatever day tense<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.933 - 00:05:30.333</b><br>okay so let's put that down<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.100 - 00:05:32.466</b><br>let's look at my trades for the day<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.466 - 00:05:33.866</b><br>okay that first trade<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.866 -

00:07:55.266</b><br>that means it doubled its price again on the day<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.133 - 00:07:59.400</b><br>what a beautiful trade but anyway I wasn't involved and<br></p><p><b>00:07:59.566 -

00:12:09.533</b><br>price should be<br></p><p><b>00:12:09.933 - 00:12:11.466</b><br>the crowd has to decide<br></p><p><b>00:12:11.500 - 00:12:14.600</b><br>so if one big seller is trying to unload his load<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.500 - 00:12:17.866</b><br>the market makers will usually step out of the way<br></p><p><b>00:12:18.100 - 00:12:20.200</b><br>let him drop the price of the market<br></p><p><b>00:12:20.266 - 00:12:22.066</b><br>and then as soon as he's gone<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.066 - 00:12:22.333</b><br>they<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.333 - 00:12:24.966</b><br>start to return the market back to its original price<br></p><p><b>00:12:25.000 - 00:12:26.333</b><br>so that's what happened today<br></p><p><b>00:12:26.766 - 00:12:29.266</b><br>and here's the guy so in the order flow<br></p><p><b>00:12:29.266 - 00:12:31.066</b><br>you can see 10 10 10 10 10<br></p><p><b>00:12:31.066 - 00:12:31.933</b><br>I bought some<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.400 - 00:12:34.733</b><br>tens here and I got these nines right here<br></p><p><b>00:12:35.166 - 00:12:36.933</b><br>somebody got some 82's<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.933 - 00:12:38.733</b><br>I don't know that's one lucky guy<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.766 - 00:12:40.500</b><br>and then boom<br></p><p><b>00:12:40.666 - 00:12:43.666</b><br>here's the guy finishing off what he had<br></p><p><b>00:12:43.933 - 00:12:45.366</b><br>somebody came along made a big<br></p><p><b>00:12:45.366 - 00:12:47.500</b><br>offer and he just let it all go<br></p><p><b>00:12:48.733 - 00:12:51.966</b><br>one way that you know this is the end of the big guy<br></p><p><b>00:12:52.166 - 00:12:53.500</b><br>is because it's so big<br></p><p><b>00:12:53.800 - 00:12:55.800</b><br>and secondly because it's an<br></p><p><b>00:12:55.800 - 00:13:00.933</b><br>odd number that he sold it's 235,316 shares<br></p><p><b>00:13:00.933 - 00:13:03.800</b><br>so that odd number tells you that he's done<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.933 - 00:13:04.933</b><br>he's finished<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.133 - 00:13:08.566</b><br>you know he sold a bunch of you know 10 lots and<br></p><p><b>00:13:08.600 - 00:13:09.800</b><br>20 lots and<br></p><p><b>00:13:09.866 - 00:13:11.900</b><br>and then all of a sudden somebody offered him<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.066 - 00:13:15.333</b><br>everything and he just sold all of his shares<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.400 - 00:13:18.133</b><br>so now there's no seller left in the market<br></p><p><b>00:13:18.866 - 00:13:20.266</b><br>the seller is gone<br></p><p><b>00:13:20.733 - 00:13:21.533</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:13:21.533 - 00:13:25.066</b><br>I'm gonna stop this video right now because we're at 13<br></p><p><b>00:13:25.066 - 00:13:26.700</b><br>minutes and we're gonna run out of time<br></p><p><b>00:13:26.766 - 00:13:27.533</b><br>I'm just gonna<br></p><p><b>00:13:27.533 - 00:13:29.066</b><br>skip forward to the next video<br></p><p><b>00:13:29.066 - 00:13:30.800</b><br>so it'll be just underneath this one<br></p><p><b>00:13:31.366 - 00:13:33.133</b><br>if you just go to the next video<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.166 - 00:13:34.266</b><br>I'll just finish off<br></p><p><b>00:13:34.266 - 00:13:35.800</b><br>this conversation that we're having<br></p><p><b>00:13:36.066 - 00:13:38.966</b><br>because it's an important thing to understand<br></p><p><b>00:13:39.266 - 00:13:40.966</b><br>the way volume works<br></p><p><b>00:13:40.966 - 00:13:43.466</b><br>and how you can read what's happening<br></p><p><b>00:13:43.600 - 00:13:46.500</b><br>and when you have that information when you know<br></p><p><b>00:13:46.733 - 00:13:48.200</b><br>that there was a seller<br></p><p><b>00:13:48.300 - 00:13:51.266</b><br>he dropped the market and now he's gone<br></p><p><b>00:13:52.100 - 00:13:54.100</b><br>now the market can only go up<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.600 - 00:13:57.966</b><br>it's nowhere else to go because the guy is gone<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.533 - 00:14:01.900</b><br>so I'll explain that a little further in the next video<br></p></body></html>
