00:00:31.666</b><br>I was going over my old videos because I<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.000 - 00:00:33.266</b><br>mentioned that I'm going to start<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.500 - 00:00:35.133</b><br>reposting them onto the steam<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.133 -

00:00:54.566</b><br>they discuss really tons of penny stock trading<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.700 - 00:00:57.800</b><br>which doesn't really necessarily apply to<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.400 - 00:00:59.600</b><br>cryptocurrencies<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.766 - 00:01:02.166</b><br>you know it's a lot more dangerous in the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.166 - 00:01:04.566</b><br>you've got to use a lot of different other strategies<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.566 - 00:01:06.300</b><br>and it's going to get confusing<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.300 - 00:01:08.000</b><br>for people who are just trying<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.000 - 00:01:08.700</b><br>new<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.700 - 00:01:11.333</b><br>traders who are just trying to implement my strategy<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.966 - 00:01:13.866</b><br>on crypto trading<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.866 - 00:01:14.600</b><br>to have all these<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.600 - 00:01:17.133</b><br>other strategies all messed around in their heads by<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.133 - 00:01:18.766</b><br>seeing these penny stock trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.900 - 00:01:19.700</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.866 - 00:01:21.900</b><br>you might want to just avoid watching them<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.900 - 00:01:23.866</b><br>or maybe I won't post the ones that<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.166 - 00:01:25.266</b><br>don't deal with<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.700 - 00:01:27.766</b><br>cryptocurrencies at all because<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.600 - 00:01:30.400</b><br>I just don't want to confuse everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.300 - 00:01:32.000</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.000 - 00:01:32.800</b><br>like<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.666 - 00:01:35.333</b><br>let's take a look at the theorem right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.333 - 00:01:37.466</b><br>you know the strategy that I'm trying to implement<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.466 - 00:01:38.333</b><br>with everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.366 - 00:01:42.566</b><br>is very simple and you know basically always works<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.166 - 00:01:44.166</b><br>and so you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.166 - 00:01:46.900</b><br>it's what we always talk about about drawing bases<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.900 - 00:01:48.766</b><br>which is very simple to draw<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.966 - 00:01:51.166</b><br>and safe areas to buy<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.166 - 00:01:54.666</b><br>and safe areas to buy and drawing your base<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.666 - 00:01:57.333</b><br>and safe areas to buy and so forth you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.066 - 00:01:59.766</b><br>real easy stuff but then<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.100 - 00:02:01.900</b><br>in the video that I'm going over right now<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.900 - 00:02:03.266</b><br>that I just was watching<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.900 - 00:02:06.400</b><br>it was part 1 called trading is easy<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.700 - 00:02:10.466</b><br>and you know it was done many many months back and<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.966 - 00:02:12.333</b><br>it was the basic<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.333 - 00:02:13.900</b><br>so I kind of wanted to give it to you guys<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.900 - 00:02:15.166</b><br>because it's the basics where I<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.166 - 00:02:17.166</b><br>discussed the bid and the ask<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.166 - 00:02:20.000</b><br>and what moves the market and a few things like that<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.000 - 00:02:21.166</b><br>but then I go into<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.466 - 00:02:23.666</b><br>you know trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.100 - 00:02:24.733</b><br>in<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.733 - 00:02:26.500</b><br>like my trades of the day in<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.366 - 00:02:32.566</b><br>penny stocks and strategies that don't really apply<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.733 - 00:02:34.166</b><br>like one of the strategies is<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.166 - 00:02:35.166</b><br>to take the very first<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.166 - 00:02:37.966</b><br>pull back on something that's running really hard<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.733 - 00:02:41.066</b><br>and so for an example today<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.500 - 00:02:43.766</b><br>if you were to try to convert it into<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.666 - 00:02:47.700</b><br>into trading cryptocurrencies I know today<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.066 - 00:02:49.466</b><br>running really hard was G<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.700 - 00:02:52.600</b><br>it was GS something<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.266 - 00:02:54.500</b><br>let me go find it for you<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.266 - 00:02:58.733</b><br>GR GRS so like look at that thing<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.733 - 00:03:01.300</b><br>you know ah that looks like penny stocks you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.400 - 00:03:03.400</b><br>goes up really hard and your very first<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.400 - 00:03:04.500</b><br>pullback is your<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.500 - 00:03:06.366</b><br>safe is your safe buy<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.500 - 00:03:08.933</b><br>so if you were to blow this up a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.900 - 00:03:10.500</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.500 - 00:03:12.666</b><br>your very first pull back would have been this one<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.100 - 00:03:15.200</b><br>but okay so where's my<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.900 - 00:03:18.166</b><br>yeah okay so I have so it would<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.800 - 00:03:21.766</b><br>oh just let me pause the video for a second<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.166 - 00:03:23.000</b><br>sorry about that<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.066 - 00:03:25.533</b><br>just a quick penny stock trade was going off there<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.533 - 00:03:26.333</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.700 - 00:03:29.200</b><br>yeah so on in this situation<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.600 - 00:03:32.133</b><br>your very first pull back would have been this right<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.133 - 00:03:34.200</b><br>from 18 all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.300 - 00:03:37.200</b><br>13 135 or something<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.366 - 00:03:39.533</b><br>and if you bought right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.766 - 00:03:42.766</b><br>well you might have meet third<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.133 - 00:03:46.500</b><br>oh no it's happening again sorry I'll be back<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.600 - 00:03:47.600</b><br>sorry I<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.866 - 00:03:49.700</b><br>have to pause the video every so often for those<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.500 - 00:03:50.933</b><br>for those moves<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.933 - 00:03:53.466</b><br>but anyway you can see that looks like your very first<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.466 - 00:03:54.400</b><br>pull back here<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.533 - 00:03:56.066</b><br>from 18 to<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.766 - 00:03:58.600</b><br>you know just 1350 or something<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.100 - 00:04:00.800</b><br>only bounced to 15<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.800 - 00:04:03.700</b><br>but it didn't this isn't really the situation<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.933 - 00:04:06.166</b><br>because you're playing<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.800 - 00:04:09.000</b><br>something that's very volatile it started at<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.000 - 00:04:10.966</b><br>9 and went all the way up to 18<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.400 - 00:04:12.933</b><br>so the only way to<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.933 - 00:04:15.333</b><br>play this chart and make it make sense<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.466 - 00:04:18.133</b><br>would be to go down to a 5 minute chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.400 - 00:04:20.700</b><br>and look what happens on a 5 minute chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.100 - 00:04:24.266</b><br>on a 5 minute chart you get this huge move up<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.466 - 00:04:28.166</b><br>a pull back and then if you were buying that pull back<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.166 - 00:04:30.100</b><br>then you get a massive bounce<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.266 - 00:04:33.366</b><br>then a pull back and another massive bounce<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.566 - 00:04:36.700</b><br>then a pull back and guess what no bounce off that one<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.766 - 00:04:38.900</b><br>so you have to react really really fast<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.900 - 00:04:40.166</b><br>then you get a drop<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.466 - 00:04:42.366</b><br>off of what we would call a base right<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.166 - 00:04:44.800</b><br>you call maybe that a base<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.866 - 00:04:45.533</b><br>you get a drop<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.533 - 00:04:47.566</b><br>here's your base before that it still work<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.566 - 00:04:49.466</b><br>like you could still totally trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.933 - 00:04:51.100</b><br>my style<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.100 - 00:04:55.266</b><br>but it's so fast because you're on 5 minute bars<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.300 - 00:04:57.466</b><br>so you get a pull back there's your safe zone<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.966 - 00:05:00.566</b><br>and you get your nice little bounce back to your base<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.866 - 00:05:02.800</b><br>and then now here of course is your base<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.800 - 00:05:05.066</b><br>you can call this your base you call that your base<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.100 - 00:05:06.366</b><br>but you got a safe zone<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.533 - 00:05:08.300</b><br>and you got to bounce off of that zone<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.300 - 00:05:11.333</b><br>so you can still trade my way no problem<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.800 - 00:05:13.400</b><br>but it's a little fast<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.400 - 00:05:15.733</b><br>it's a little crazy and you're dealing with something<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.733 - 00:05:18.500</b><br>that just jumped like massively right<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.000 - 00:05:22.533</b><br>you're doing something that just<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.566 - 00:05:23.966</b><br>you know is on a tear<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.966 - 00:05:26.000</b><br>and is very dangerous and can<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.000 - 00:05:27.700</b><br>easily come back down to seven<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.700 - 00:05:28.700</b><br>and if you're not<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.700 - 00:05:31.266</b><br>working within those five minute time frames<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.466 - 00:05:32.066</b><br>ah<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.066 - 00:05:33.533</b><br>you know whereas when<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.533 - 00:05:35.800</b><br>with the work with the stuff that we normally do<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.466 - 00:05:40.100</b><br>and high percentages though so it's it's fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.100 - 00:05:41.400</b><br>I would totally trade this<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.300 - 00:05:43.133</b><br>but only<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.733 - 00:05:48.300</b><br>you know on a faster on a faster time frame sorry<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.300 - 00:05:49.133</b><br>going back to<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.333 - 00:05:51.700</b><br>theorem this is a nice slow<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.400 - 00:05:56.400</b><br>this is a nice slow timeframe where you have to work<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.400 - 00:05:57.333</b><br>one hour bars<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.333 - 00:05:59.333</b><br>and it's very easy for everybody to do<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.500 - 00:06:01.400</b><br>and people are busy with their lives<br></p><p><b>00:06:01.400 -

00:07:29.800</b><br>there and you decided to buy this little spot and<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.600 - 00:07:34.100</b><br>then all of a sudden it starts running away on you<br></p><p><b>00:07:34.300 - 00:07:36.900</b><br>and this starts not to make sense and<br></p><p><b>00:07:36.900 - 00:07:38.266</b><br>what are you going to buy more<br></p><p><b>00:07:39.133 - 00:07:40.533</b><br>are you gonna buy here<br></p><p><b>00:07:41.266 - 00:07:42.466</b><br>and here<br></p><p><b>00:07:42.800 - 00:07:44.466</b><br>and then start to get really nervous<br></p><p><b>00:07:44.466 - 00:07:45.666</b><br>and you're buying here<br></p><p><b>00:07:45.700 - 00:07:47.900</b><br>and the thing just is running away on you so hard<br></p><p><b>00:07:47.900 - 00:07:49.333</b><br>and even though it's a theorem and you know<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.333 - 00:07:50.200</b><br>it's gonna bounce<br></p><p><b>00:07:50.200 - 00:07:52.533</b><br>it could take days for it to bounce back<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.666 -

00:08:31.533</b><br>you know the cryptocurrency market<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.166 - 00:08:33.366</b><br>maybe just avoid them<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.400 - 00:08:36.966</b><br>or just don't don't look at them as<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.600 -

00:09:08.066</b><br>if you're new<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.300 - 00:09:09.766</b><br>and you're learning how to trade<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.766 - 00:09:11.566</b><br>and you're trying to build coins<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.266 - 00:09:13.100</b><br>do what I'm doing<br></p><p><b>00:09:13.100 - 00:09:13.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.300 - 00:09:16.666</b><br>I'm not taking those little five minute trades on<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.800 -
