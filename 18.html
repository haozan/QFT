00:00:06.000</b><br>so not too much action really with Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.400 - 00:00:07.400</b><br>the fork did happen<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.400 - 00:00:10.000</b><br>but BCC haven't even mined their first<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.900 - 00:00:11.966</b><br>block yet so<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.200 - 00:00:14.900</b><br>I think the market's not quite as worried about<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.966 - 00:00:17.400</b><br>BCC as they were at first<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.900 - 00:00:20.000</b><br>the hashing power is not there<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.166 - 00:00:24.600</b><br>and so it takes like an hour and a half to mine a block<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.766 - 00:00:27.133</b><br>and so I just don't think that there's<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.133 - 00:00:30.366</b><br>enough support that it's making everybody freak out<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.166 - 00:00:33.366</b><br>so this is basically how it went this morning<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.366 - 00:00:35.566</b><br>I was up at 820 ready for the fork<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.100 - 00:00:37.966</b><br>and the fork happened somewhere right about<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.966 - 00:00:39.666</b><br>right there at Lake<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.766 - 00:00:42.533</b><br>it was at 2950<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.533 - 00:00:45.400</b><br>it dropped all the way down to 2700 ish<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.566 - 00:00:47.266</b><br>and then the fork happened<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.266 - 00:00:47.966</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.966 - 00:00:50.600</b><br>when the fork was happening we were back up near 28<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.800 - 00:00:51.600</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.133 - 00:00:55.566</b><br>after the fork it dropped all the way down to 2550<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.200 - 00:00:58.266</b><br>and now we got to bounce back up to 27<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.566 - 00:01:01.133</b><br>so what I did is<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.866 - 00:01:03.000</b><br>I didn't have very<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.566 - 00:01:06.133</b><br>much bitcoin over at Bitrex but<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.466 - 00:01:09.566</b><br>I waited for Bitrex to put my BCC in a wallet<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.666 - 00:01:11.933</b><br>and so if you have an account with Bitrex right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.933 - 00:01:12.866</b><br>and you go to their wallet<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.866 - 00:01:14.500</b><br>you'll see that you have BCC in it<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.133 - 00:01:16.800</b><br>so I waited for that to happen<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.800 - 00:01:19.200</b><br>and then as soon as it's been forked<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.200 - 00:01:20.966</b><br>the BCC is now in my wallet<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.566 - 00:01:22.733</b><br>then I sold my<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.000 - 00:01:25.366</b><br>the bitcoin that I had on the Bittrex exchange<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.366 - 00:01:27.900</b><br>I sold around 2700 something like that<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.166 - 00:01:30.500</b><br>and I'm just out<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.866 - 00:01:33.766</b><br>temporarily while I wait to see if a panic happens<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.100 - 00:01:36.733</b><br>if no panic happens in 4 or 5 hours from now<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.900 - 00:01:39.066</b><br>I'll probably just buy my BCC back<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.000 - 00:01:41.566</b><br>my bitcoin back on<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.800 - 00:01:43.666</b><br>in Bitrex so that at least I can keep on<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.666 - 00:01:45.133</b><br>trading and everything's normal<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.133 - 00:01:50.000</b><br>the bitcoin that I hold in storage in cold wallets<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.900 - 00:01:52.000</b><br>that's all safe<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.000 - 00:01:54.066</b><br>and that has nothing to do with anything<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.533 - 00:01:58.266</b><br>all the only bitcoin that I sold is the one<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.266 - 00:02:00.366</b><br>is the bitcoin that I have over at betrax<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.366 - 00:02:02.500</b><br>okay so next<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.933 - 00:02:03.966</b><br>so I'm happy to<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.966 - 00:02:06.166</b><br>show you guys the new scanner that we have now<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.533 - 00:02:07.900</b><br>this was created by Dogfish<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.900 - 00:02:09.866</b><br>and this is gonna be a great tool for us<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.933 - 00:02:11.933</b><br>and I'm gonna post<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.400 - 00:02:14.100</b><br>link to the scanner for everybody<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.400 - 00:02:15.600</b><br>he's been working hard<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.933 - 00:02:19.133</b><br>to make this so that it can handle all the users<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.600 - 00:02:20.700</b><br>so anyway I'm going to post a link<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.700 - 00:02:21.933</b><br>so you guys can get this scanner<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.933 - 00:02:24.366</b><br>I'm also going to post a link to his email<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.733 - 00:02:26.100</b><br>and to his steam it blog<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.100 -

00:02:34.600</b><br>he was kind enough at the top of this scanner<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.800 - 00:02:37.466</b><br>in the about section the about button right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.666 - 00:02:42.400</b><br>to put a link to my blog so that if anybody online<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.400 - 00:02:46.800</b><br>comes up and sees this scanner and wants to understand<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.400 - 00:02:50.566</b><br>how we use it then they can go to my blog<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.400 - 00:02:53.366</b><br>and then he's got another button here for donate<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.366 - 00:02:56.200</b><br>so if you appreciate the work that he's put into this<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.600 - 00:02:58.400</b><br>then you can just go ahead and<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.500 - 00:03:00.300</b><br>go to one of his addresses here<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.366 - 00:03:03.066</b><br>and donate so that would be great<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.966 - 00:03:04.733</b><br>so just a<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.733 - 00:03:07.366</b><br>quick overview of what we can do with this scanner<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.400 - 00:03:09.600</b><br>so up at the very top here<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.700 - 00:03:12.600</b><br>I have my filter set for<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.933 - 00:03:16.066</b><br>you know if we got a 10%<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.066 - 00:03:18.000</b><br>or a minimum of 10% drop<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.000 - 00:03:21.100</b><br>within the last five minutes and a tenth of a bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.733 - 00:03:23.800</b><br>is the volume in a 24 hour<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.466 - 00:03:27.066</b><br>period then it will hit this scanner<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.800 - 00:03:29.733</b><br>but you can hit this little button change<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.733 - 00:03:31.000</b><br>and you can go ahead and change<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.000 - 00:03:32.966</b><br>those filters if you want to change them<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.000 - 00:03:35.866</b><br>that way you don't even have to interact with him<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.866 - 00:03:37.100</b><br>you can just go ahead and change<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.100 - 00:03:38.933</b><br>those and make them whatever you want them to be<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.266 - 00:03:40.366</b><br>and then he's got<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.733 - 00:03:45.733</b><br>51234 he's got four exchanges listed so far<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.166 - 00:03:47.366</b><br>Hitbit Liquid<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.466 - 00:03:49.100</b><br>Polynex and Vitrex<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.133 - 00:03:51.600</b><br>so you can see that I've checked off Hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.600 - 00:03:53.133</b><br>and I've checked off Vitrex<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.133 - 00:03:55.100</b><br>those are the ones that I'm using right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.866 - 00:03:58.500</b><br>and so that's all that's going to show up in the scan<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.966 - 00:04:00.166</b><br>in live data<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.900 - 00:04:03.000</b><br>you will get whatever just happens right now<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.000 - 00:04:05.666</b><br>so it's going to look exactly like in recent over here<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.800 - 00:04:07.300</b><br>but it's going to<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.900 - 00:04:09.133</b><br>going to be just whatever<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.133 - 00:04:10.566</b><br>happened within the past minute<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.566 - 00:04:11.366</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.800 - 00:04:14.966</b><br>this thing continually refreshes so it's always always<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.600 - 00:04:17.166</b><br>what just just happened<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.866 - 00:04:20.466</b><br>recent over here in recent<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.266 - 00:04:23.900</b><br>you'll see that 6 minutes ago ADX<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.733 - 00:04:26.700</b><br>ETH<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.300 - 00:04:28.266</b><br>on Hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.200 - 00:04:31.000</b><br>had a 12 percent drop<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.166 - 00:04:34.133</b><br>and this is a beautiful feature that he included<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.700 - 00:04:37.133</b><br>it keeps the bit and the ass current so<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.266 - 00:04:39.733</b><br>so although the drop was from<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.300 - 00:04:42.200</b><br>6 1 down to 5 4<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.200 - 00:04:44.400</b><br>without even going to the<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.400 - 00:04:46.733</b><br>exchange and trying to look at level 2<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.733 - 00:04:48.100</b><br>or looking at the chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.166 - 00:04:49.900</b><br>you can just immediately look at the<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.900 - 00:04:51.500</b><br>current bit in the ask<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.566 - 00:04:53.866</b><br>and say you know is it still available<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.866 - 00:04:54.933</b><br>could I still buy it<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.933 - 00:04:58.700</b><br>or if you were gonna right now put an order in at 195<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.700 - 00:05:00.933</b><br>because you said okay drop from 22<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.933 - 00:05:04.500</b><br>down to 195 I'm gonna put my order in at 195<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.733 - 00:05:07.200</b><br>well just looking over to this column you'd see that<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.200 - 00:05:10.733</b><br>somebody's got an order in front of you at 1952<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.566 - 00:05:13.600</b><br>so your order at one95<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.600 - 00:05:16.000</b><br>there's just no chance it would execute because<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.066 - 00:05:18.200</b><br>somebody's already outbidding that order<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.300 - 00:05:21.900</b><br>so this is a beautiful thing to have like a current<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.266 - 00:05:25.000</b><br>bit and ask so those are some great features now<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.600 - 00:05:26.466</b><br>in blue<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.533 - 00:05:29.133</b><br>you can see that there's you can see that there's some<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.300 - 00:05:33.000</b><br>alerts coming out right now and you can hear the sound<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.066 - 00:05:34.933</b><br>you got a little mute button right there<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.333 - 00:05:37.000</b><br>you can hear the sound as they're coming in<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.400 - 00:05:39.500</b><br>so if you were going to<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.766 - 00:05:42.400</b><br>touch on the blue this is again one of those linking<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.866 - 00:05:45.933</b><br>things so that you can click on it and go<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.933 - 00:05:47.266</b><br>directly to the chart<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.666 - 00:05:50.933</b><br>and boom you can see the drop it's as clear as day<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.133 - 00:05:54.100</b><br>and even though over here in<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.266 - 00:05:55.766</b><br>Kanegi it's saying<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.900 - 00:05:59.600</b><br>the bit is 5 to 1 and the ask is 5 9<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.866 - 00:06:01.366</b><br>if we go back to here<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.500 - 00:06:04.733</b><br>actually that's correct but generally<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.166 - 00:06:07.300</b><br>Kanigi will be behind and<br></p><p><b>00:06:07.300 - 00:06:09.966</b><br>their level 2 just won't give you the correct data<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.000 - 00:06:11.733</b><br>meanwhile his level 2 will<br></p><p><b>00:06:11.966 - 00:06:12.766</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:06:13.266 - 00:06:14.566</b><br>this is such a big<br></p><p><b>00:06:16.766 - 00:06:21.100</b><br>advantage to have the current bitten ask on this filter<br></p><p><b>00:06:22.200 - 00:06:22.866</b><br>this is a really<br></p><p><b>00:06:22.866 - 00:06:24.733</b><br>short video because I just want to get back to trading<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.733 - 00:06:27.133</b><br>I just want you guys to get a chance to have this<br></p><p><b>00:06:27.600 - 00:06:30.333</b><br>market scanner as soon as possible now that I<br></p><p><b>00:06:30.733 - 00:06:32.266</b><br>was given permission to give it to you<br></p><p><b>00:06:33.000 - 00:06:36.333</b><br>so one other thing I should mention is that right here<br></p><p><b>00:06:36.333 - 00:06:37.800</b><br>see these little boxes right here<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.966 - 00:06:40.600</b><br>these are links to the actual exchange<br></p><p><b>00:06:40.600 - 00:06:42.100</b><br>so this one takes you to Kenigi<br></p><p><b>00:06:42.100 -
