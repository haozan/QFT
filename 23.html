00:00:21.700</b><br>so I got a bunch of free bitcoin cash<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.733 - 00:00:23.400</b><br>so I started selling over here<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.533 - 00:00:25.866</b><br>and then my wife is like what about my wallet<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.866 - 00:00:27.500</b><br>and she had a wallet<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.733 - 00:00:29.866</b><br>she had a wallet with some bitcoin in it and<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.133 - 00:00:31.566</b><br>we didn't split it so<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.100 -

00:00:39.000</b><br>but she was having fun with me<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.133 - 00:00:41.800</b><br>so we sold some of her bitcoin cash and we bought some<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.800 - 00:00:43.466</b><br>back and we sold and we bought some back<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.466 - 00:00:44.266</b><br>it was a lot of fun<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.266 - 00:00:46.466</b><br>anyway so she's off to work<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.466 - 00:00:48.866</b><br>this afternoon and I thought I just made a quick video<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.933 - 00:00:49.733</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.300 - 00:00:52.766</b><br>I'd like to announce to everybody some new tools<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.766 - 00:00:53.966</b><br>so you know how much I like tools<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.966 - 00:00:55.400</b><br>that helps your trading a lot<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.700 - 00:00:57.166</b><br>so what do we have right now<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.166 - 00:00:58.333</b><br>so far we have<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.400 - 00:01:00.533</b><br>two market scanners that I've been using<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.533 - 00:01:01.933</b><br>I hope that you guys have been using<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.000 - 00:01:04.966</b><br>that shows you quick percent drops right so<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.500 - 00:01:07.966</b><br>that allows you to get those account building trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.166 - 00:01:09.500</b><br>that allows you to get those<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.566 - 00:01:12.933</b><br>breakout trades where<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.366 - 00:01:15.166</b><br>something's taking off and then it gives you a<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.166 - 00:01:16.200</b><br>quick pullback and<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.200 - 00:01:18.000</b><br>then you get the alert and you have a<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.000 - 00:01:19.266</b><br>chance to get in at that point<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.366 - 00:01:20.533</b><br>or those account building<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.533 - 00:01:21.200</b><br>trades where there's high<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.200 - 00:01:22.466</b><br>percentages and it's going back<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.466 - 00:01:23.900</b><br>and forth and<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.366 - 00:01:26.366</b><br>so that's alerting us to those things<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.500 - 00:01:28.133</b><br>they also have those links on them<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.133 - 00:01:28.800</b><br>where you can just<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.800 - 00:01:30.266</b><br>click on it go straight to the chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.900 - 00:01:32.133</b><br>it's got sounds<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.133 - 00:01:34.900</b><br>so it's wonderful what we've got so far is wonderful<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.133 - 00:01:36.500</b><br>this next thing<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.300 - 00:01:38.566</b><br>people have been asking for<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.566 - 00:01:41.600</b><br>and of course I'm not a coder so I can't work on it<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.333 - 00:01:47.400</b><br>but somebody built us a base braking scanner<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.666 - 00:01:50.900</b><br>so when just when the bases are starting to break<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.533 - 00:01:57.300</b><br>we get alerted to that and to do that we have to go to<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.566 - 00:01:59.200</b><br>slat chat room so<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.566 - 00:02:02.600</b><br>here's a chat room that Tizzle created<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.700 - 00:02:05.000</b><br>and so please direct your questions to him<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.000 - 00:02:06.500</b><br>he's the moderator of the room<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.700 - 00:02:09.333</b><br>and you know I don't know much about Slack<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.333 - 00:02:10.166</b><br>so I understand<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.166 - 00:02:12.000</b><br>there's a bunch of channels and that you can<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.166 - 00:02:12.900</b><br>you can<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.900 - 00:02:15.266</b><br>link and subscribe to all these different channels<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.266 - 00:02:17.366</b><br>and here's the channels that<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.366 - 00:02:19.133</b><br>are the scanner channels right<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.133 - 00:02:21.266</b><br>so scanner alerts<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.466 - 00:02:24.766</b><br>alert for BTC alert for ether and alert for fiat<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.366 - 00:02:28.733</b><br>and so he wrote down here that we have a new bot<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.300 - 00:02:30.300</b><br>to the Slack that<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.300 - 00:02:32.766</b><br>scans for bases that are beginning to crack<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.766 - 00:02:34.800</b><br>so that's pretty exciting for lots of people<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.800 - 00:02:37.466</b><br>who have been setting all of these alerts on Kenigi<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.700 - 00:02:40.700</b><br>and waiting for them to hit the alerts<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.700 - 00:02:42.133</b><br>and you know it's a lot of<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.133 - 00:02:43.000</b><br>effort to keep on<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.000 - 00:02:44.166</b><br>setting up your alerts and when<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.166 - 00:02:45.400</b><br>something gets hit and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.400 - 00:02:47.333</b><br>so lots of people have been asking for this<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.333 - 00:02:48.533</b><br>type of a scanner<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.000 - 00:02:50.733</b><br>and so there's a member over here<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.100 - 00:02:51.900</b><br>Naiwa<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.966 -

00:03:02.533</b><br>and here's what the alerts kind of look like<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.800 - 00:03:03.900</b><br>so you get a chart<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.900 - 00:03:06.300</b><br>like a little thumbnail chart which is pretty cool<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.300 - 00:03:08.066</b><br>right and you can see like there's a little<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.066 - 00:03:08.766</b><br>blue line here<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.766 - 00:03:10.666</b><br>that kind of shows you where the base should be<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.266 -
