00:00:42.133</b><br>why I'm collecting free coins and the whole<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.133 - 00:00:42.666</b><br>this like<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.666 - 00:00:45.700</b><br>a real basic part to the mythology of what I'm doing<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.700 - 00:00:46.500</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.100 - 00:00:49.866</b><br>to my trading method but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.066 - 00:00:51.566</b><br>maybe we can talk about that for a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.566 - 00:00:51.900</b><br>also<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.900 - 00:00:54.900</b><br>everybody's asking me constantly sending me messages<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.066 - 00:00:57.300</b><br>asking me questions about stock trading<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.500 - 00:01:02.200</b><br>and I don't want to teach anybody how to trade stocks<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.200 - 00:01:04.100</b><br>it's not the same market<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.166 - 00:01:06.800</b><br>I started my steam it and<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.333 - 00:01:10.333</b><br>I'm in Slack every day and all that kind of stuff<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.333 - 00:01:12.000</b><br>I'm answering questions because<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.333 - 00:01:13.366</b><br>this is a really<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.366 - 00:01:15.933</b><br>easy market to trade and I just wanted to help people<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.933 - 00:01:18.933</b><br>and there's so much money to be made<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.933 - 00:01:20.200</b><br>right here in crypto<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.566 - 00:01:23.166</b><br>that you don't have to go into a dangerous market like<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.166 - 00:01:24.500</b><br>penny stocks<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.600 - 00:01:28.900</b><br>it's just dangerous and hard to trade and I love it<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.900 - 00:01:31.266</b><br>don't get me wrong I love it I trade it all day<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.400 - 00:01:33.966</b><br>Monday to Friday 9 30 to 4<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.100 - 00:01:35.300</b><br>I'm trading stocks<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.300 - 00:01:36.733</b><br>and when I'm in slack<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.766 - 00:01:38.200</b><br>and I'm chit chatting with everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.200 - 00:01:40.533</b><br>and especially during all of this crazy movement<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.533 - 00:01:42.400</b><br>I'm chit chatting with everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.900 - 00:01:44.100</b><br>for<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.100 - 00:01:46.700</b><br>I'll move that over so that my face is not in the way<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.266 - 00:01:49.366</b><br>when I'm doing that<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.300 - 00:01:51.866</b><br>I barely have time to even talk<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.866 - 00:01:53.666</b><br>because I'm trading stocks at the same time<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.666 - 00:01:55.066</b><br>and they all know I'm trading stocks<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.066 - 00:01:57.766</b><br>so people are constantly asking me questions about<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.900 - 00:01:59.266</b><br>you know what do you use<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.266 - 00:02:01.766</b><br>and how do you find the stocks that you're trading and<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.000 - 00:02:03.133</b><br>you know all that kind of stuff<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.133 - 00:02:06.600</b><br>and yes I'm making money trading stocks all day<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.866 - 00:02:07.666</b><br>it's true<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.333 - 00:02:09.400</b><br>but it's not easy<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.500 - 00:02:12.733</b><br>it's not easy like this it's not predictable<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.933 - 00:02:15.733</b><br>like this this market is super predictable<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.000 - 00:02:19.766</b><br>so I mean why not if you're new to trading why<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.200 - 00:02:22.733</b><br>even start to think about stocks<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.766 - 00:02:24.766</b><br>why pay the heavy commissions<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.600 - 00:02:26.933</b><br>right so like<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.600 - 00:02:30.900</b><br>you know you can pay up to $500 a month in commission<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.900 - 00:02:33.666</b><br>you can pay $1,000 a month in commission if you really<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.933 - 00:02:35.266</b><br>if you're really trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.066 - 00:02:36.866</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.200 - 00:02:39.533</b><br>just for the subscription to my charting package<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.533 - 00:02:40.900</b><br>the one the charting package that I use<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.900 - 00:02:43.666</b><br>that's another 250 dollars a month<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.100 - 00:02:47.400</b><br>so there you are now you're up to $750 a month<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.666 - 00:02:49.800</b><br>and then your data fees<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.800 - 00:02:50.500</b><br>you know with the<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.500 - 00:02:52.600</b><br>broker that you decide to use is going to be<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.800 - 00:02:53.200</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.200 - 00:02:55.466</b><br>another hundred or a hundred and fifty dollars a month<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.733 - 00:02:58.733</b><br>you know why have that thousand dollar overhead<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.466 - 00:03:02.333</b><br>instead of just being able to trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.466 - 00:03:03.566</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.700 - 00:03:05.800</b><br>the commissions the reason that they're so high is<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.800 - 00:03:09.266</b><br>it cost me $5 to buy a stock and $5 to sell<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.466 - 00:03:11.133</b><br>whereas here in cryptoland<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.166 - 00:03:15.733</b><br>you know you can buy just a few coins and you get<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.166 - 00:03:17.000</b><br>a slight<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.166 - 00:03:18.866</b><br>percentage commission on that<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.266 - 00:03:21.166</b><br>it doesn't cost you $5<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.166 - 00:03:23.366</b><br>you know it might cost you 10 cents or something<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.533 - 00:03:25.566</b><br>it just varies<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.066 - 00:03:28.333</b><br>to the amount of coins that you're buying<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.600 - 00:03:31.133</b><br>so I mean it's just so much better and the<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.166 - 00:03:32.866</b><br>and the market is so much better<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.933 - 00:03:36.066</b><br>but I understand that it's slower right<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.200 - 00:03:37.800</b><br>so in the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.866 - 00:03:38.933</b><br>you know I'm in a<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.933 - 00:03:40.166</b><br>trade for five minutes<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.166 - 00:03:43.366</b><br>10 minutes sometimes half an hour if it's a long trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.166 - 00:03:45.466</b><br>you know whereas here<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.700 - 00:03:50.000</b><br>I'm working off one hour one hour candle charts<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.066 - 00:03:52.733</b><br>so every candle on here is an hour so like<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.400 - 00:03:56.333</b><br>you know it's slow you might be in a trade for days<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.333 - 00:03:58.000</b><br>you might be in a trade for a day<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.100 - 00:03:59.666</b><br>you might be in a trade for a week<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.933 - 00:04:01.666</b><br>you know and it gets really<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.666 - 00:04:04.166</b><br>slow and people get impatient and they want the action<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.166 - 00:04:05.266</b><br>but the action<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.733 - 00:04:08.333</b><br>it's like battling a war over there in the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.333 - 00:04:09.666</b><br>so you can get killed so<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.666 - 00:04:11.700</b><br>easily because there's bullets flying everywhere<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.700 - 00:04:14.966</b><br>there's traps around every corner whereas here<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.566 - 00:04:18.400</b><br>ah it's so easy it's so simple<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.400 - 00:04:21.166</b><br>especially if you figured out my method<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.333 - 00:04:22.166</b><br>and you're<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.166 - 00:04:24.466</b><br>looking for those panics those panics are as<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.466 - 00:04:25.566</b><br>obvious as day<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.966 - 00:04:27.133</b><br>look at this chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.133 - 00:04:28.333</b><br>I mean okay<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.266 - 00:04:30.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.100 - 00:04:32.966</b><br>let's take this back to a one day chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.933 - 00:04:35.866</b><br>let's just go back in time a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.300 - 00:04:37.866</b><br>let's just make this bigger<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.500 - 00:04:39.500</b><br>go back in time<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.366 - 00:04:42.866</b><br>all right<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.866 - 00:04:44.333</b><br>so when we were here<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.300 - 00:04:45.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.900 - 00:04:48.866</b><br>this thing is just screaming sell sell sell sell sell<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.866 - 00:04:50.333</b><br>so obviously I was<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.500 - 00:04:54.566</b><br>running low on my free bitcoins all<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.066 - 00:04:56.466</b><br>those coins that I've<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.666 - 00:04:58.533</b><br>that I've accumulated through all of<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.533 - 00:04:58.866</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.866 - 00:05:01.500</b><br>this section and this section and this section<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.066 - 00:05:04.566</b><br>and as it's running up I'm just like<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.566 -

00:05:18.000</b><br>of the coin the chart that I'm trading as<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.100 - 00:05:20.466</b><br>any free coins that I have is still 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.500 - 00:05:23.066</b><br>when I start to get that hot potato filling right<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.100 - 00:05:27.100</b><br>so let's just say let's just say you had 5 bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.366 - 00:05:30.133</b><br>and you know this thing started to run up like crazy<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.133 -

00:07:19.533</b><br>you can see there was a lot of buyers<br></p><p><b>00:07:19.766 - 00:07:20.900</b><br>do I have a marker<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.933 - 00:07:25.500</b><br>you can see there was a lot of buyers right here<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.500 - 00:07:26.566</b><br>you know this was<br></p><p><b>00:07:26.600 - 00:07:27.666</b><br>definitely<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.933 - 00:07:30.900</b><br>a base that just was insane<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.900 -

00:07:55.000</b><br>I mean there is just no safer place to be buying right<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.100 - 00:07:56.400</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.400 - 00:07:58.566</b><br>sorry let's just go back to one hour<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.000 - 00:08:03.700</b><br>and let's scroll this back to a reasonable area<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.666 - 00:08:06.200</b><br>yeah okay sorry<br></p><p><b>00:08:07.966 - 00:08:08.900</b><br>let's put on something<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.900 -

00:08:42.066</b><br>up here<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.266 - 00:08:44.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.366 - 00:08:46.466</b><br>back when we were at 19000<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.266 - 00:08:48.666</b><br>I put in my book<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.100 -

00:09:03.500</b><br>you know take this dip<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.533 - 00:09:06.366</b><br>you know make your free make your<br></p><p><b>00:09:06.500 - 00:09:08.700</b><br>your circle right and then looking for<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.800 - 00:09:09.766</b><br>obvious space<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.800 - 00:09:11.133</b><br>and then make your circle<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.133 - 00:09:11.966</b><br>and buy by buy<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.966 - 00:09:14.366</b><br>and sell sell sell and then look for an obvious space<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.700 - 00:09:17.333</b><br>and then you know make your circle this<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.466 - 00:09:18.300</b><br>little time thing<br></p><p><b>00:09:18.300 - 00:09:19.666</b><br>and then sell sell sell and then<br></p><p><b>00:09:19.666 -

00:09:34.400</b><br>in this case bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.500 - 00:09:36.900</b><br>you can invest into a coin you're interested in<br></p><p><b>00:09:37.800 - 00:09:40.366</b><br>but it never cost you anything right so<br></p><p><b>00:09:40.533 - 00:09:43.266</b><br>so let's say over here at<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.800 - 00:09:48.000</b><br>19 thousand let's say you had a hundred thousand dollar<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.366 - 00:09:52.200</b><br>account you know in fiat not that it's in fiat but<br></p><p><b>00:09:52.300 - 00:09:55.566</b><br>the value in fiat is $100,000 let's say<br></p><p><b>00:09:56.500 - 00:09:58.466</b><br>so when you get this nice big dip here<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.600 - 00:09:59.933</b><br>and you get to buy<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.066 -

00:10:14.566</b><br>20 000 in this drop<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.366 - 00:10:16.466</b><br>well once you<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.466 - 00:10:19.066</b><br>once you sell and sell you get your 20,000 back<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.200 - 00:10:21.366</b><br>the rest is free coins<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.133 - 00:10:23.566</b><br>right so maybe you've made<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.566 - 00:10:24.666</b><br>a bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.733 -

00:10:31.166</b><br>that you can go and put away<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.366 - 00:10:34.000</b><br>and just you know send to your wallet or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:10:34.000 - 00:10:35.933</b><br>and get it off the exchange if that helps<br></p><p><b>00:10:35.966 - 00:10:36.933</b><br>your mindset<br></p><p><b>00:10:37.366 - 00:10:38.533</b><br>but just put it away<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.000 - 00:10:42.733</b><br>and you still have your hundred thousand dollar account<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.166 - 00:10:45.966</b><br>right and then so then you've drawn your base<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.966 - 00:10:47.166</b><br>and now here's your safe<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.166 - 00:10:48.566</b><br>circle you're gonna buy in<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.666 -

00:10:58.700</b><br>and then once you hit back to your<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.200 - 00:11:02.366</b><br>where you started let's say in this section here<br></p><p><b>00:11:02.500 - 00:11:04.733</b><br>you've invested 20 or 30 thousand<br></p><p><b>00:11:05.133 - 00:11:05.933</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.100 - 00:11:09.266</b><br>now you can sell sell sell and when you<br></p><p><b>00:11:09.733 - 00:11:11.533</b><br>get back your initial money again<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.900 - 00:11:14.466</b><br>then whatever's left over is free coins that you can<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.466 - 00:11:15.800</b><br>again send to your wallet<br></p><p><b>00:11:16.066 - 00:11:17.866</b><br>so basically through this whole section<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.866 -

00:25:11.333</b><br>a channel to be able to trade<br></p><p><b>00:25:11.333 - 00:25:12.500</b><br>but I've been doing it steady<br></p><p><b>00:25:13.133 - 00:25:15.066</b><br>but there's some pretty good whips<br></p><p><b>00:25:15.066 - 00:25:15.466</b><br>but the<br></p><p><b>00:25:15.466 - 00:25:18.666</b><br>percentages are awesome because you're down in these 10<br></p><p><b>00:25:18.766 - 00:25:21.966</b><br>and 9 and 8 so just the other day we were at<br></p><p><b>00:25:21.966 - 00:25:23.766</b><br>7 and then back up to 14<br></p><p><b>00:25:23.800 - 00:25:25.566</b><br>there there's 100 percent right there<br></p><p><b>00:25:25.733 - 00:25:28.733</b><br>and you know a little while before that there's 11<br></p><p><b>00:25:28.866 - 00:25:31.166</b><br>all the way up to 19 you know<br></p><p><b>00:25:31.300 - 00:25:33.600</b><br>so you get all these nice whips back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:25:33.700 - 00:25:37.900</b><br>really easy to you know if you were trading back here<br></p><p><b>00:25:38.100 - 00:25:39.866</b><br>and you called this your channel<br></p><p><b>00:25:40.566 - 00:25:42.600</b><br>let's say you called that your channel right there<br></p><p><b>00:25:43.366 - 00:25:44.166</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:25:44.766 - 00:25:47.266</b><br>like I was saying you might be able to layer<br></p><p><b>00:25:47.266 - 00:25:49.066</b><br>let's say you put some layers in<br></p><p><b>00:25:49.066 - 00:25:51.300</b><br>to buy lower if it ever happens<br></p><p><b>00:25:51.300 - 00:25:54.100</b><br>then all of here you get these nice lower things<br></p><p><b>00:25:54.933 - 00:25:57.100</b><br>it's just just like position<br></p><p><b>00:25:57.366 - 00:25:59.933</b><br>trading you can try to figure out what your average is<br></p><p><b>00:25:59.933 - 00:26:02.066</b><br>right so if you got all of these your average would<br></p><p><b>00:26:02.066 - 00:26:04.100</b><br>likely be here or maybe here<br></p><p><b>00:26:04.133 - 00:26:05.333</b><br>and then on this whip<br></p><p><b>00:26:05.533 -

00:26:11.533</b><br>and on this whip maybe you get one or two of them out<br></p><p><b>00:26:12.066 - 00:26:13.166</b><br>and then you get back in<br></p><p><b>00:26:13.166 - 00:26:14.966</b><br>and then on this whip you get one or two of them out<br></p><p><b>00:26:14.966 - 00:26:16.266</b><br>and then all you get them all out<br></p><p><b>00:26:16.333 - 00:26:17.933</b><br>and there you go you're back to<br></p><p><b>00:26:18.800 - 00:26:20.200</b><br>you know increasing your think<br></p><p><b>00:26:20.200 -
