00:00:05.533</b><br>let's tear up some charts<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.966 - 00:00:07.066</b><br>it's been crazy<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.066 - 00:00:08.933</b><br>there's been a lot of stuff happening lately<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.000 - 00:00:12.400</b><br>those bitcoin transaction times are ridiculous like<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.533 - 00:00:14.166</b><br>over 30 hours<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.166 - 00:00:16.766</b><br>for me to send a bitcoin transaction the other day<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.000 - 00:00:19.333</b><br>that is insane<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.700 - 00:00:22.000</b><br>so and it's because I was sending it from one of the<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.000 - 00:00:24.333</b><br>exchanges and they use a standard fee<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.333 - 00:00:27.133</b><br>they don't allow you to upgrade to the premium fee<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.700 - 00:00:30.600</b><br>so the premium fee would allow you maybe to get your<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.900 - 00:00:31.500</b><br>transaction<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.500 - 00:00:32.966</b><br>put into a block but it's gonna cost you like<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.966 - 00:00:34.566</b><br>50 bucks right<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.733 - 00:00:37.566</b><br>and the standard fee is only gonna cost whatever it is<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.566 - 00:00:38.166</b><br>10 15<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.166 - 00:00:40.366</b><br>dollars or something which is still a lot but<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.900 - 00:00:43.133</b><br>so it will be<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.133 - 00:00:44.166</b><br>less money but then<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.166 - 00:00:45.533</b><br>you're not guaranteed to be putting the<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.533 - 00:00:46.933</b><br>block and then you're stuck<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.000 - 00:00:49.733</b><br>in this unconfirmed transaction forever<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.966 - 00:00:53.266</b><br>and look at these unconfirmed transactions<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.000 - 00:00:54.933</b><br>so right now<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.933 - 00:00:59.133</b><br>there is almost 250 thousand unconfirmed transactions<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.700 - 00:01:03.466</b><br>that's just insanity like if you're new to bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.733 - 00:01:06.400</b><br>right imagine all those people who are just<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.533 - 00:01:08.400</b><br>figuring out bitcoin and they're coming in<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.500 - 00:01:10.133</b><br>and they go send a transaction<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.133 - 00:01:12.066</b><br>and they're going to wait over a day<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.200 - 00:01:15.600</b><br>you know and they're gonna pay either they're gonna pay<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.733 - 00:01:17.933</b><br>45 bucks or 50 bucks or something<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.933 - 00:01:20.533</b><br>and go into the premium and and<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.533 - 00:01:21.566</b><br>manage to get into the<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.566 - 00:01:23.533</b><br>block and it only takes a few minutes you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.533 - 00:01:24.566</b><br>10 minutes or something<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.966 - 00:01:27.933</b><br>or they're gonna get stuck like this<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.300 - 00:01:29.566</b><br>that's just ridiculous<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.566 - 00:01:31.600</b><br>so you know that's gonna turn a lot of people off<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.600 - 00:01:32.300</b><br>and I understand<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.300 - 00:01:32.866</b><br>that right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.866 - 00:01:34.866</b><br>the miners moved over to bitcoin cash because<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.866 - 00:01:36.300</b><br>difficulty is less<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.333 - 00:01:37.133</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.866 - 00:01:39.766</b><br>you know there's not as many miners over here<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.766 - 00:01:41.333</b><br>and with bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.333 - 00:01:43.066</b><br>and so that's what's slowing the system down<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.066 - 00:01:44.000</b><br>and whatnot and there's<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.000 - 00:01:46.900</b><br>an overwhelming response of people all trying<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.900 - 00:01:48.933</b><br>you know the market is crashing<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.166 - 00:01:51.466</b><br>and so everybody's trying to send their money<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.533 - 00:01:52.400</b><br>their bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.566 - 00:01:54.266</b><br>from their wallets over to the<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.266 - 00:01:56.700</b><br>exchange so that they can try to get out of it<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.766 - 00:02:00.100</b><br>before the market is completely tanked on them<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.266 - 00:02:02.800</b><br>and so it's causing this mass panic and then<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.800 - 00:02:03.866</b><br>nobody can move<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.000 - 00:02:05.100</b><br>their bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.400 - 00:02:06.666</b><br>and it just gets crazy<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.166 - 00:02:09.000</b><br>meanwhile over on Bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.300 - 00:02:11.066</b><br>what I heard is<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.333 - 00:02:12.866</b><br>you can move money around<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.866 - 00:02:15.133</b><br>you can make a transaction for a dollar or two<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.266 - 00:02:19.000</b><br>so it's super cheap and all the miners over there<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.000 - 00:02:20.133</b><br>so it moves around fast<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.133 - 00:02:22.200</b><br>and there's not as many people using Bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.200 - 00:02:24.600</b><br>so it moves around even faster and so forth right<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.100 - 00:02:26.600</b><br>so anyway I don't know all that stuff<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.733 - 00:02:28.466</b><br>and that's not what my videos are about<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.700 - 00:02:31.900</b><br>I'm just really surprised really shocked<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.100 - 00:02:33.700</b><br>that it took me over a day<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.733 - 00:02:36.800</b><br>to move my funds using Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.866 - 00:02:38.866</b><br>and I know that annoyed me<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.200 - 00:02:40.333</b><br>and I know that<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.400 - 00:02:42.766</b><br>means that it's going to annoy everybody<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.766 - 00:02:45.966</b><br>and then the market wants to fall at the same time<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.333 - 00:02:47.133</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.900 - 00:02:50.700</b><br>then there's all of this FUD right is<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.700 - 00:02:51.400</b><br>all these people<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.400 - 00:02:53.166</b><br>that are promoting Bitcoin cash and saying<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.166 - 00:02:54.466</b><br>that's the real bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.066 - 00:02:57.733</b><br>so that's going to be turning new players off of<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.166 - 00:02:58.966</b><br>off of<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.533 - 00:03:02.400</b><br>Bitcoin core so I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.933 - 00:03:05.766</b><br>okay so this is great for trading right<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.766 - 00:03:07.766</b><br>I don't want to get into the discussion of whether<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.766 - 00:03:09.466</b><br>Bitcoin is the real bitcoin or<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.466 - 00:03:10.766</b><br>is it you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.766 - 00:03:12.666</b><br>bitcoin cash or is it bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.666 - 00:03:14.600</b><br>hold or is it super Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.766 - 00:03:17.200</b><br>or is it bitcoin lightning or<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.533 - 00:03:18.266</b><br>oh my goodness<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.266 - 00:03:20.000</b><br>there has just been so many forks and so many<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.000 - 00:03:21.000</b><br>different bitcoins<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.700 - 00:03:23.000</b><br>so what's the real bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.166 - 00:03:24.533</b><br>who knows but here's the thing<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.200 - 00:03:27.066</b><br>the thing is there's an argument going on<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.066 - 00:03:29.066</b><br>and when there's an argument going on and people<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.066 - 00:03:30.400</b><br>are starting to get worried<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.666 - 00:03:31.900</b><br>that gives us stuff to trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.900 - 00:03:33.533</b><br>and that's what I've always told you guys<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.766 - 00:03:35.366</b><br>you want to trade something<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.366 - 00:03:36.800</b><br>where there's an argument going on<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.800 - 00:03:39.166</b><br>where there's disbelievers and believers<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.366 - 00:03:41.166</b><br>buyers and sellers<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.500 - 00:03:42.400</b><br>moving the market up<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.400 - 00:03:44.366</b><br>and down and making for a beautiful market<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.366 - 00:03:45.500</b><br>that's what we have<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.266 - 00:03:49.300</b><br>so what's the future of actual bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.500 - 00:03:51.533</b><br>you know will bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.766 - 00:03:54.900</b><br>overtake bitcoin and become the real bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.700 - 00:04:00.300</b><br>I don't know there's some really big players<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.300 - 00:04:01.966</b><br>that are trying to promote bitcoin cash<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.966 - 00:04:04.700</b><br>right now and so that's making volatility<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.700 - 00:04:06.933</b><br>so what have I been trading in the past two days<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.066 - 00:04:08.566</b><br>I've been trading bitcoin cash<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.566 - 00:04:10.066</b><br>and I've been trading bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.133 -

00:06:06.466</b><br>so I'm just gonna pause the video every once in a while<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.466 - 00:06:08.533</b><br>take a few bites of my food while we<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.666 - 00:06:10.200</b><br>tear this chart apart<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.700 - 00:06:12.000</b><br>but okay so<br></p><p><b>00:06:12.700 - 00:06:14.766</b><br>we can start drawing all the bases right<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.766 - 00:06:16.966</b><br>we can just look for balances and be like okay<br></p><p><b>00:06:16.966 - 00:06:18.733</b><br>there was a balance right here at<br></p><p><b>00:06:19.466 - 00:06:21.900</b><br>1550 and you can see that that's right<br></p><p><b>00:06:21.900 - 00:06:23.466</b><br>around that same area back here<br></p><p><b>00:06:23.466 - 00:06:24.666</b><br>so that's you<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.800 - 00:06:26.166</b><br>you definitely got a really good<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.300 - 00:06:27.066</b><br>run off of that<br></p><p><b>00:06:27.066 - 00:06:27.266</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:06:27.266 - 00:06:29.333</b><br>you definitely got a really good bounce off of that<br></p><p><b>00:06:29.333 - 00:06:31.666</b><br>which means that the buyers are sitting here<br></p><p><b>00:06:31.700 - 00:06:33.866</b><br>at you know around 15 500<br></p><p><b>00:06:34.066 - 00:06:35.166</b><br>there's a lot of buyers<br></p><p><b>00:06:35.166 - 00:06:37.800</b><br>so that's going to cause quite the panic when it<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.800 - 00:06:38.866</b><br>breaks through<br></p><p><b>00:06:39.400 - 00:06:42.333</b><br>that spot and they did that on a panic<br></p><p><b>00:06:42.333 - 00:06:43.600</b><br>you know like they didn't even pause<br></p><p><b>00:06:43.600 - 00:06:44.666</b><br>they went straight through<br></p><p><b>00:06:44.766 - 00:06:47.966</b><br>so you get that we got that initial bounce right from<br></p><p><b>00:06:47.966 - 00:06:48.900</b><br>I don't know 14<br></p><p><b>00:06:50.066 - 00:06:54.000</b><br>460 all the way back up to 15 thousand five hundred<br></p><p><b>00:06:54.266 - 00:06:56.766</b><br>so we got that 1,000 dollar bounce<br></p><p><b>00:06:57.100 - 00:06:57.900</b><br>right there<br></p><p><b>00:06:58.500 - 00:07:01.800</b><br>and that's great and you know if you were quick and you<br></p><p><b>00:07:02.166 - 00:07:04.600</b><br>tried to get in on this trade which I<br></p><p><b>00:07:04.600 - 00:07:06.733</b><br>might have because of where it fell from<br></p><p><b>00:07:06.733 - 00:07:08.466</b><br>because it was such a nice extreme<br></p><p><b>00:07:09.366 - 00:07:12.000</b><br>bounce like a extreme panic<br></p><p><b>00:07:12.200 - 00:07:14.366</b><br>I probably would have got in on this<br></p><p><b>00:07:14.366 - 00:07:15.566</b><br>and you know maybe I did<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.566 - 00:07:17.800</b><br>we'll have to go look at my charts<br></p><p><b>00:07:17.866 - 00:07:19.800</b><br>we'll go look at my trades in a few minutes but<br></p><p><b>00:07:19.800 - 00:07:21.966</b><br>I probably got in on this and sold right away<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.133 - 00:07:22.800</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.800 - 00:07:23.966</b><br>because I knew that<br></p><p><b>00:07:23.966 - 00:07:26.566</b><br>even though this is bouncing it's now hitting<br></p><p><b>00:07:26.566 - 00:07:27.766</b><br>all those scared<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.766 - 00:07:30.933</b><br>once was buyers now turn sellers right<br></p><p><b>00:07:31.133 - 00:07:34.266</b><br>all these guys that maybe didn't sell fast enough<br></p><p><b>00:07:34.300 - 00:07:35.600</b><br>are going to try to sell now<br></p><p><b>00:07:35.600 - 00:07:37.266</b><br>as soon as they get a second chance<br></p><p><b>00:07:37.333 - 00:07:41.400</b><br>so anyway you get this nice quick little relief bounce<br></p><p><b>00:07:41.533 - 00:07:44.066</b><br>and then back to panic you know<br></p><p><b>00:07:45.000 - 00:07:46.200</b><br>so what I would have done<br></p><p><b>00:07:47.000 - 00:07:48.700</b><br>let me get rid of that little thing<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.000 - 00:07:50.900</b><br>what I would have done is this would have<br></p><p><b>00:07:50.900 - 00:07:52.666</b><br>definitely been our base<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.700 - 00:07:55.600</b><br>but now that we we received that little 1000<br></p><p><b>00:07:55.900 - 00:07:58.266</b><br>dollar bounce which is quite a bit $1,000<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.900 - 00:07:59.966</b><br>now that we receive that balance<br></p><p><b>00:07:59.966 - 00:08:01.466</b><br>this would be my new base<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.466 - 00:08:03.866</b><br>I would just immediately drawn in this base<br></p><p><b>00:08:03.900 - 00:08:07.500</b><br>and now I would be taking anything under here right<br></p><p><b>00:08:07.866 - 00:08:10.900</b><br>and so let's zoom in a little bit so we get this<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.066 - 00:08:13.066</b><br>this panic and<br></p><p><b>00:08:13.666 - 00:08:16.100</b><br>panic down to about 13 right here on the first<br></p><p><b>00:08:16.166 - 00:08:19.266</b><br>on the first two hours boom panic down to there<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.933 - 00:08:21.966</b><br>which would now be our new base<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.266 - 00:08:23.733</b><br>and a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.800 - 00:08:27.266</b><br>right back up to the previous base and you can still<br></p><p><b>00:08:27.466 - 00:08:29.100</b><br>you can still trade all of this<br></p><p><b>00:08:29.100 - 00:08:31.400</b><br>off of this base because<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.566 - 00:08:36.100</b><br>it's happening so fast<br></p><p><b>00:08:36.100 - 00:08:38.300</b><br>that it's really all just one big panic<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.400 - 00:08:40.200</b><br>but you can easily draw<br></p><p><b>00:08:40.700 - 00:08:43.166</b><br>these little things and take even safer trades<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.466 - 00:08:45.800</b><br>but anyway it would have all worked out as you can see<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.933 - 00:08:49.766</b><br>so we get a thousand drop 1 thousand bounce<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.866 - 00:08:52.400</b><br>then we get another thousand drop all the way<br></p><p><b>00:08:52.400 - 00:08:53.866</b><br>down to just under 1200<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.100 - 00:08:57.966</b><br>and bounce all the way back up to 14<br></p><p><b>00:08:58.733 - 00:09:00.300</b><br>so that's just gorgeous right<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.866 - 00:09:03.400</b><br>so you could have gone wrong in this entire circle<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.400 - 00:09:04.500</b><br>this entire thing<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.566 - 00:09:08.066</b><br>now you could easily go ahead and draw yourself a new<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.300 - 00:09:09.366</b><br>base right there<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.600 - 00:09:13.133</b><br>but because it was such a fast Wick you can see like<br></p><p><b>00:09:13.200 - 00:09:15.400</b><br>it just responded so so quickly<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.400 - 00:09:16.866</b><br>you don't even have a body in here<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.400 - 00:09:18.366</b><br>that's because<br></p><p><b>00:09:18.366 - 00:09:20.166</b><br>look at this volume that showed up<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.166 - 00:09:21.866</b><br>this massive amount of volume<br></p><p><b>00:09:21.866 - 00:09:23.733</b><br>so that made that thing just pop<br></p><p><b>00:09:23.866 - 00:09:26.866</b><br>that's your first sign that's your first indication<br></p><p><b>00:09:26.900 - 00:09:29.300</b><br>you might be close to a bottom<br></p><p><b>00:09:29.700 - 00:09:33.766</b><br>at temporary bottom not not at the bottom of Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.800 - 00:09:35.333</b><br>just a temporary bottom<br></p><p><b>00:09:35.400 - 00:09:38.066</b><br>when you start to see fast moves like this where<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.066 - 00:09:39.733</b><br>as soon as it gets to a certain<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.733 - 00:09:41.266</b><br>point like here at 1200<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.366 - 00:09:43.800</b><br>the buyers just took it up really really fast<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.966 - 00:09:45.466</b><br>they're giving you a clue<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.733 - 00:09:48.533</b><br>that the big money is really starting to soak it up<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.533 - 00:09:50.366</b><br>here they want those coins<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.133 - 00:09:53.000</b><br>so off of that clue<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.133 - 00:09:55.066</b><br>the thing runs all the way back up to 14<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.700 - 00:09:57.566</b><br>and then we get this another panic<br></p><p><b>00:09:57.566 - 00:10:00.333</b><br>and look at that as soon as we pass that 12<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.600 - 00:10:03.200</b><br>and we got into some real hot territory<br></p><p><b>00:10:03.766 - 00:10:06.700</b><br>those buyers just jumped in so fast and ran<br></p><p><b>00:10:07.466 - 00:10:08.600</b><br>that price Rake back up<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.600 - 00:10:11.000</b><br>and I watched that happen and I was like whole<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.100 - 00:10:15.000</b><br>I barely got a trade in because it happened so fast<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.133 - 00:10:17.066</b><br>like this is a one hour bar<br></p><p><b>00:10:17.066 - 00:10:20.200</b><br>but in reality that was like within a 10 minute span<br></p><p><b>00:10:20.333 - 00:10:21.566</b><br>all the way down to 11<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.166 - 00:10:24.266</b><br>all the way back up to 13 you know<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.566 - 00:10:28.366</b><br>so like a 2000 dollar move really really fast<br></p><p><b>00:10:28.733 - 00:10:31.866</b><br>so that's yet another clue<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.966 - 00:10:34.266</b><br>that you're getting near temporary bottom<br></p><p><b>00:10:34.266 - 00:10:36.600</b><br>and look at these volume bars<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.766 - 00:10:39.266</b><br>like look how much volume in comparison to the other<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.266 - 00:10:40.066</b><br>volume<br></p><p><b>00:10:40.866 - 00:10:42.566</b><br>that that happened there<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.600 - 00:10:44.700</b><br>okay let me pause the video I'll just take quickly<br></p><p><b>00:10:44.800 - 00:10:46.700</b><br>so I was having a pretty well the same<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.100 - 00:10:48.700</b><br>conversation with my wife<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.700 - 00:10:51.066</b><br>she came into the office right here<br></p><p><b>00:10:52.066 - 00:10:53.266</b><br>and I was like you know<br></p><p><b>00:10:53.266 - 00:10:55.766</b><br>I'm kind of thinking about buying these 13's<br></p><p><b>00:10:55.766 - 00:10:57.700</b><br>and you know we already got<br></p><p><b>00:10:57.766 - 00:10:59.166</b><br>you know here's our bases<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.166 - 00:11:01.333</b><br>here's our major base here's our bases<br></p><p><b>00:11:01.700 - 00:11:03.166</b><br>and I've you know I've already been<br></p><p><b>00:11:03.200 - 00:11:05.533</b><br>you know buying maybe here and selling there<br></p><p><b>00:11:05.533 - 00:11:07.933</b><br>and buying over here and selling there<br></p><p><b>00:11:08.333 - 00:11:10.066</b><br>buying over here and selling there<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.066 - 00:11:11.133</b><br>and then all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.133 - 00:11:12.100</b><br>I'm going to do something<br></p><p><b>00:11:12.100 - 00:11:13.733</b><br>that we don't talk about right<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.133 - 00:11:17.400</b><br>I'm thinking about buying up here which is not below<br></p><p><b>00:11:18.000 - 00:11:19.366</b><br>this last base<br></p><p><b>00:11:19.366 - 00:11:21.766</b><br>it's not a normal typical place for me to buy<br></p><p><b>00:11:22.100 - 00:11:23.766</b><br>but I'm going to tell you why<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.166 - 00:11:25.500</b><br>I was thinking about buying<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.200 - 00:11:28.333</b><br>so to do that what you really got to do<br></p><p><b>00:11:28.333 - 00:11:29.466</b><br>let me take everything off<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.566 - 00:11:31.766</b><br>is you got to look into the past and you got to say<br></p><p><b>00:11:31.933 - 00:11:33.700</b><br>okay I'm seeing real<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.766 - 00:11:36.300</b><br>evidence that we're coming near a temporary bottom<br></p><p><b>00:11:36.733 - 00:11:38.766</b><br>there's a lot of volume coming in<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.866 - 00:11:40.733</b><br>saying that you know I've seen this<br></p><p><b>00:11:40.733 - 00:11:42.466</b><br>so many times they're soaking these<br></p><p><b>00:11:42.600 - 00:11:45.200</b><br>these coins they're just taking as much or<br></p><p><b>00:11:45.200 - 00:11:46.866</b><br>sometimes you call it they're stuffing<br></p><p><b>00:11:47.066 - 00:11:48.766</b><br>right they're just taking all<br></p><p><b>00:11:48.933 - 00:11:51.966</b><br>that the sellers that are panicking will give them<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.966 - 00:11:53.900</b><br>and they're taking it so fast<br></p><p><b>00:11:53.933 - 00:11:56.133</b><br>that you barely don't even get a chance to get in<br></p><p><b>00:11:56.133 - 00:11:58.066</b><br>like if you try to get an order in here<br></p><p><b>00:11:58.166 - 00:12:00.700</b><br>unless you have the order set up in advance<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.866 - 00:12:02.166</b><br>you almost don't have a chance<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.166 -

00:12:29.166</b><br>you just go way back<br></p><p><b>00:12:29.200 - 00:12:31.566</b><br>and you look for this amount of volume<br></p><p><b>00:12:31.600 - 00:12:32.766</b><br>and at the time<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.133 -

00:13:05.766</b><br>and this chunk of volume back here in the past<br></p><p><b>00:13:06.166 - 00:13:08.566</b><br>and you can go all the way back<br></p><p><b>00:13:08.600 - 00:13:10.933</b><br>and go grab that chunk of volume but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:13:11.000 - 00:13:13.466</b><br>the point is that this is a lot of volume<br></p><p><b>00:13:13.866 - 00:13:15.200</b><br>in comparison to these<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.466 - 00:13:17.866</b><br>and if you weren't dial in on these<br></p><p><b>00:13:20.566 -

00:14:14.533</b><br>the buyers just start to go up<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.300 - 00:14:16.700</b><br>everybody stops panicking<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.700 - 00:14:18.733</b><br>and there's like a little period in here<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.733 - 00:14:20.266</b><br>there's just a little section<br></p><p><b>00:14:20.400 - 00:14:22.700</b><br>where people are starting to realize<br></p><p><b>00:14:23.100 - 00:14:27.366</b><br>that there doesn't for like five six hours seven hours<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.533 -

00:14:36.700</b><br>if we go back into the past again<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.500 - 00:14:39.466</b><br>and we look for the same thing again<br></p><p><b>00:14:41.933 - 00:14:44.300</b><br>you'll see the panic and the Wick<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.400 - 00:14:46.666</b><br>and then it goes up and you think it's<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.966 - 00:14:48.366</b><br>just going to continue higher and higher<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.366 - 00:14:49.566</b><br>and then you get a second panic<br></p><p><b>00:14:49.566 -

00:14:55.466</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.600 - 00:14:58.266</b><br>then you know this one they didn't trick you as much<br></p><p><b>00:14:58.400 - 00:15:01.133</b><br>but in some of them especially when it's a large<br></p><p><b>00:15:01.133 - 00:15:02.700</b><br>big drop they really do<br></p><p><b>00:15:03.766 - 00:15:04.933</b><br>play it out and try to trick you<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.933 - 00:15:06.766</b><br>oh hey I can move my picture around<br></p><p><b>00:15:08.133 - 00:15:09.466</b><br>well that's good to know<br></p><p><b>00:15:10.533 - 00:15:12.266</b><br>so anyway going back to where we were<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.800 - 00:15:16.300</b><br>and zooming in on this<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.933 - 00:15:19.000</b><br>so right over here<br></p><p><b>00:15:20.733 - 00:15:21.866</b><br>here's my drawer<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.900 - 00:15:26.333</b><br>right over here I was kind of thinking about getting in<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.500 -

00:15:33.566</b><br>don't get me wrong<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.566 - 00:15:36.400</b><br>and this is definitely not the safest thing to do<br></p><p><b>00:15:36.566 - 00:15:40.300</b><br>but I just could not ignore all of this volume<br></p><p><b>00:15:40.300 - 00:15:42.366</b><br>there was so much volume there that I was like<br></p><p><b>00:15:42.666 - 00:15:44.800</b><br>oh man those 11s<br></p><p><b>00:15:44.800 - 00:15:47.066</b><br>I don't know if we're going to see those 11s again<br></p><p><b>00:15:47.133 - 00:15:47.866</b><br>until<br></p><p><b>00:15:47.866 - 00:15:51.133</b><br>this thing has a chance to get back up to those 1500<br></p><p><b>00:15:51.400 - 00:15:53.400</b><br>you know maybe even 1550<br></p><p><b>00:15:53.733 -

00:16:13.333</b><br>and that there's<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.366 - 00:16:15.566</b><br>a major scary and everybody's paying high rates and<br></p><p><b>00:16:15.666 - 00:16:18.400</b><br>there's a lot of things a lot of negatives right now<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.666 - 00:16:20.466</b><br>that's going to be scaring a lot of people<br></p><p><b>00:16:20.466 - 00:16:22.000</b><br>who bought way up at the top<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.000 - 00:16:26.766</b><br>and then also that 2 20,000 dollar level<br></p><p><b>00:16:26.933 - 00:16:30.300</b><br>was a very very psychological level<br></p><p><b>00:16:31.000 - 00:16:31.533</b><br>like this<br></p><p><b>00:16:31.533 - 00:16:34.533</b><br>it's huge and it got right to the tippity tip of it<br></p><p><b>00:16:34.566 - 00:16:36.200</b><br>and then turned itself around<br></p><p><b>00:16:36.533 - 00:16:37.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:16:38.166 - 00:16:39.100</b><br>it only makes sense<br></p><p><b>00:16:39.100 - 00:16:40.733</b><br>that it's going to come back down to 10<br></p><p><b>00:16:40.733 -

00:16:47.800</b><br>11 is getting really close to that 10 000<br></p><p><b>00:16:47.800 - 00:16:49.566</b><br>so people jump on it pretty quick<br></p><p><b>00:16:49.700 - 00:16:51.966</b><br>and the volume says that<br></p><p><b>00:16:52.166 -

00:16:58.966</b><br>okay let me take another bite okay so<br></p><p><b>00:17:00.400 - 00:17:00.733</b><br>all right<br></p><p><b>00:17:00.733 - 00:17:03.066</b><br>let's look at my let's look at my actual trains<br></p><p><b>00:17:04.800 - 00:17:06.200</b><br>so okay while<br></p><p><b>00:17:06.500 - 00:17:07.800</b><br>while this video is happening<br></p><p><b>00:17:07.800 - 00:17:10.266</b><br>Bitcoin decides to turn down and start to try to panic<br></p><p><b>00:17:10.266 - 00:17:11.500</b><br>everybody very nice<br></p><p><b>00:17:12.300 - 00:17:14.800</b><br>okay so you can see I was selling right there at<br></p><p><b>00:17:15.300 - 00:17:17.900</b><br>19200 and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:17:18.333 - 00:17:19.366</b><br>and I bought a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:17:19.900 - 00:17:21.933</b><br>right here at about 17 8<br></p><p><b>00:17:22.766 - 00:17:23.333</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:17:23.333 - 00:17:25.466</b><br>there was a little bounce and I know you can't see a<br></p><p><b>00:17:25.466 - 00:17:26.900</b><br>cell but I think I got a little bit of a<br></p><p><b>00:17:26.900 - 00:17:27.800</b><br>cell off of there<br></p><p><b>00:17:28.900 - 00:17:30.966</b><br>anyway I don't remember what this was about<br></p><p><b>00:17:31.366 - 00:17:32.900</b><br>I think that<br></p><p><b>00:17:33.866 - 00:17:35.933</b><br>my wife came in and wanted something<br></p><p><b>00:17:35.933 - 00:17:37.900</b><br>and I was buying for her maybe<br></p><p><b>00:17:37.966 -

00:18:00.800</b><br>for this one so<br></p><p><b>00:18:01.400 - 00:18:04.500</b><br>we got a really nice little drop all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:18:04.766 - 00:18:05.566</b><br>looks like 15<br></p><p><b>00:18:06.166 -

00:20:02.566</b><br>so you can see if we zoom in<br></p><p><b>00:20:02.766 - 00:20:03.733</b><br>you can see that I got<br></p><p><b>00:20:03.733 - 00:20:05.533</b><br>in there and there and sold there<br></p><p><b>00:20:05.533 - 00:20:06.133</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:20:06.133 - 00:20:10.566</b><br>which is which is pretty nice that's like 4,000 14,400<br></p><p><b>00:20:10.666 - 00:20:12.966</b><br>all the way up to 15,400<br></p><p><b>00:20:12.966 - 00:20:15.533</b><br>so that's a thousand dollar move<br></p><p><b>00:20:16.766 - 00:20:17.766</b><br>I don't remember how<br></p><p><b>00:20:17.933 - 00:20:20.133</b><br>much I got but anyway it's a thousand dollar move<br></p><p><b>00:20:20.133 - 00:20:21.566</b><br>and then and then<br></p><p><b>00:20:21.600 - 00:20:24.000</b><br>it happened so fast that I got right back in<br></p><p><b>00:20:24.000 - 00:20:26.066</b><br>right here and I sold brick even<br></p><p><b>00:20:26.400 - 00:20:28.800</b><br>so I just got in and I'm like oh man<br></p><p><b>00:20:28.933 - 00:20:30.700</b><br>this thing looks like it's going to bounce<br></p><p><b>00:20:30.700 - 00:20:31.500</b><br>I waited like<br></p><p><b>00:20:31.500 - 00:20:33.400</b><br>you know I don't know an hour on this<br></p><p><b>00:20:33.466 - 00:20:34.333</b><br>and I'm like oh<br></p><p><b>00:20:34.333 - 00:20:36.166</b><br>man it's not bouncing like it's supposed to<br></p><p><b>00:20:36.166 - 00:20:37.733</b><br>it might drop off from here<br></p><p><b>00:20:37.866 - 00:20:38.666</b><br>I'm just gonna<br></p><p><b>00:20:38.900 - 00:20:41.333</b><br>let it go for even because I'm very cautious<br></p><p><b>00:20:41.966 - 00:20:43.133</b><br>so I let go for even of course<br></p><p><b>00:20:43.133 - 00:20:44.800</b><br>I got my balance and I never got myself<br></p><p><b>00:20:45.066 - 00:20:49.000</b><br>so I made a good profit right here and over here<br></p><p><b>00:20:49.066 - 00:20:51.500</b><br>I just got out even and never made the profit that<br></p><p><b>00:20:51.566 - 00:20:52.500</b><br>I was hoping for<br></p><p><b>00:20:53.500 - 00:20:55.333</b><br>but anyway then you go ahead and draw your<br></p><p><b>00:20:55.333 - 00:20:56.300</b><br>base right here<br></p><p><b>00:20:56.800 - 00:20:59.066</b><br>and that gives me a chance to get here and here<br></p><p><b>00:20:59.200 - 00:21:01.933</b><br>so you know here I got in at<br></p><p><b>00:21:02.966 - 00:21:05.266</b><br>13 13 thousand five hundred<br></p><p><b>00:21:05.333 - 00:21:07.166</b><br>and here I got in just under 13<br></p><p><b>00:21:07.200 - 00:21:08.800</b><br>so like 1290 or something<br></p><p><b>00:21:08.900 - 00:21:12.600</b><br>and sold both of those up there over 14 000<br></p><p><b>00:21:12.933 - 00:21:17.766</b><br>so again I got a nice 1000 dollar move just beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:21:17.966 - 00:21:20.100</b><br>then of course you can go ahead and draw your<br></p><p><b>00:21:20.800 - 00:21:22.266</b><br>next little base right there<br></p><p><b>00:21:23.266 - 00:21:25.500</b><br>this would have all been safe but I missed it<br></p><p><b>00:21:25.600 - 00:21:26.566</b><br>because I was really<br></p><p><b>00:21:26.566 - 00:21:29.366</b><br>I think I had my order right here just under the 12<br></p><p><b>00:21:29.600 - 00:21:32.866</b><br>and it just missed my order you know like<br></p><p><b>00:21:33.000 - 00:21:35.566</b><br>that happens in drading it's unfortunate but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:21:35.566 - 00:21:36.500</b><br>just missed my order<br></p><p><b>00:21:36.766 - 00:21:39.366</b><br>so you better believe I wasn't gonna miss it again<br></p><p><b>00:21:39.600 - 00:21:42.566</b><br>so right here I got two orders off right there<br></p><p><b>00:21:43.133 - 00:21:46.533</b><br>that was like in the 1100 so 113 let's say<br></p><p><b>00:21:46.666 - 00:21:48.766</b><br>and then around 125<br></p><p><b>00:21:49.166 - 00:21:52.533</b><br>so another 1200 dollar move<br></p><p><b>00:21:53.766 - 00:21:56.933</b><br>I got out and then I got back in right there<br></p><p><b>00:21:57.266 - 00:22:02.600</b><br>and then I watched this thing go up and right here<br></p><p><b>00:22:03.166 - 00:22:06.733</b><br>is where I made that decision based on the volume<br></p><p><b>00:22:07.000 - 00:22:10.366</b><br>you can see that this is not a loop typical trade<br></p><p><b>00:22:10.366 - 00:22:12.800</b><br>I should be waiting for it to pass this level<br></p><p><b>00:22:12.800 - 00:22:14.000</b><br>before I get in again<br></p><p><b>00:22:14.466 - 00:22:16.300</b><br>but I went and looked at the history<br></p><p><b>00:22:16.333 - 00:22:17.800</b><br>my wife had walked into the office<br></p><p><b>00:22:17.800 - 00:22:19.166</b><br>and I was telling her about<br></p><p><b>00:22:19.333 - 00:22:20.666</b><br>you know this is really how<br></p><p><b>00:22:21.300 - 00:22:22.733</b><br>the next level plays<br></p><p><b>00:22:22.733 - 00:22:23.066</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:22:23.066 - 00:22:25.933</b><br>you got to take a look and kind of guesstimate<br></p><p><b>00:22:26.100 - 00:22:29.166</b><br>on where it is that the big money is stepping in<br></p><p><b>00:22:29.266 - 00:22:30.533</b><br>and it looks right now<br></p><p><b>00:22:30.533 - 00:22:32.400</b><br>that they're temporarily stalling this out<br></p><p><b>00:22:32.400 - 00:22:33.466</b><br>and buying it up<br></p><p><b>00:22:33.800 - 00:22:35.166</b><br>so I got in<br></p><p><b>00:22:35.200 - 00:22:37.500</b><br>two little orders you can see two little arrows there<br></p><p><b>00:22:37.600 - 00:22:39.700</b><br>I got in two little orders right there<br></p><p><b>00:22:39.866 - 00:22:42.100</b><br>and I'm still in them right I<br></p><p><b>00:22:42.333 - 00:22:45.133</b><br>was in them for the run to just<br></p><p><b>00:22:45.366 - 00:22:47.366</b><br>just see how far this thing wants to go<br></p><p><b>00:22:47.566 - 00:22:49.666</b><br>so I'm still in them and I will let them go<br></p><p><b>00:22:49.666 - 00:22:51.733</b><br>if we get back down to this price<br></p><p><b>00:22:51.766 - 00:22:54.000</b><br>I'll let them go<br></p><p><b>00:22:54.800 - 00:22:57.466</b><br>because this is not a Luke typical trade<br></p><p><b>00:22:57.466 - 00:22:58.733</b><br>this is not what I do<br></p><p><b>00:22:59.066 - 00:23:02.600</b><br>it's just I'm so used to seeing these charts<br></p><p><b>00:23:02.666 - 00:23:04.400</b><br>that I knew that this was<br></p><p><b>00:23:04.400 - 00:23:06.866</b><br>probably a spot where they were gonna trick us all<br></p><p><b>00:23:07.400 - 00:23:08.066</b><br>turn this thing up<br></p><p><b>00:23:08.066 - 00:23:10.866</b><br>there was just too many buyers in this area<br></p><p><b>00:23:10.900 - 00:23:15.333</b><br>we kept returning to three 23,000 13,200<br></p><p><b>00:23:15.500 - 00:23:19.566</b><br>we kept returning to this level way way way too much<br></p><p><b>00:23:19.933 - 00:23:22.266</b><br>so it was getting pretty obvious to me<br></p><p><b>00:23:24.000 - 00:23:24.866</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:23:25.666 - 00:23:26.600</b><br>just to sum up<br></p><p><b>00:23:29.966 - 00:23:31.500</b><br>if you want to make sure that<br></p><p><b>00:23:31.733 - 00:23:33.600</b><br>you're going to be 100% successful<br></p><p><b>00:23:33.600 - 00:23:34.966</b><br>you're always going to make money<br></p><p><b>00:23:35.000 - 00:23:37.800</b><br>notice that all my trades are not you never find<br></p><p><b>00:23:37.900 - 00:23:39.333</b><br>a losing trade for me<br></p><p><b>00:23:41.000 -

00:23:53.566</b><br>but you're guessing<br></p><p><b>00:23:53.800 - 00:23:55.400</b><br>because you know when you're<br></p><p><b>00:23:55.400 - 00:23:57.400</b><br>when you're buying in that safe circle there's no<br></p><p><b>00:23:57.400 - 00:24:00.600</b><br>guesswork you know how the crowd responds<br></p><p><b>00:24:00.600 - 00:24:02.066</b><br>you know that it's gonna bounce back up<br></p><p><b>00:24:02.066 - 00:24:03.000</b><br>and you're gonna be okay<br></p><p><b>00:24:03.100 - 00:24:03.700</b><br>you know that<br></p><p><b>00:24:03.700 - 00:24:06.400</b><br>every time this happens in bitcoin you are okay<br></p><p><b>00:24:06.700 - 00:24:10.866</b><br>so these are all safe safe safe safe trades<br></p><p><b>00:24:11.100 - 00:24:12.266</b><br>but this one isn't<br></p><p><b>00:24:12.800 - 00:24:15.966</b><br>this one is me just taking a guess<br></p><p><b>00:24:16.300 - 00:24:17.900</b><br>from looking at this stuff so please don't<br></p><p><b>00:24:17.900 -

00:25:16.133</b><br>so now you are drawing your base right here<br></p><p><b>00:25:16.866 - 00:25:17.666</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:25:18.333 - 00:25:21.066</b><br>I actually let it drop quite a piece before I got in<br></p><p><b>00:25:21.200 - 00:25:23.700</b><br>so I got in around I don't know 22<br></p><p><b>00:25:23.700 - 00:25:25.200</b><br>60 or something right here<br></p><p><b>00:25:25.300 - 00:25:27.133</b><br>and I sold around 26<br></p><p><b>00:25:27.533 - 00:25:32.200</b><br>so again 22 to 26 huge huge percentages<br></p><p><b>00:25:32.333 - 00:25:33.733</b><br>now at this point<br></p><p><b>00:25:34.133 - 00:25:37.133</b><br>Bitcoin was falling really hard we're getting near<br></p><p><b>00:25:37.466 -

00:25:46.133</b><br>like this is where you put size on if you can<br></p><p><b>00:25:46.866 - 00:25:49.166</b><br>so right here I got some size<br></p><p><b>00:25:49.400 - 00:25:52.666</b><br>I went and bought some 21s and I got a good amount<br></p><p><b>00:25:53.133 -

00:26:01.966</b><br>I got in twice what I got in here<br></p><p><b>00:26:01.966 - 00:26:05.733</b><br>so let's say you bought I don't know 15 coins here<br></p><p><b>00:26:05.866 - 00:26:08.700</b><br>over here you bought an additional 30 you know like you<br></p><p><b>00:26:08.966 - 00:26:11.066</b><br>really got in some size right here<br></p><p><b>00:26:11.466 - 00:26:13.666</b><br>I'm not giving you the numbers that I actually<br></p><p><b>00:26:13.933 - 00:26:16.966</b><br>got in maybe I got in 5 and 10 I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:26:17.666 -

00:26:46.800</b><br>everything I have at Kraken<br></p><p><b>00:26:47.400 - 00:26:50.200</b><br>if that would have ever made that kind of a drop<br></p><p><b>00:26:50.733 - 00:26:51.900</b><br>and the only reason<br></p><p><b>00:26:52.133 - 00:26:53.566</b><br>and I say this to you guys<br></p><p><b>00:26:53.600 - 00:26:54.000</b><br>a lot<br></p><p><b>00:26:54.000 - 00:26:56.366</b><br>but the only reason that you can put size on these<br></p><p><b>00:26:56.366 - 00:26:58.766</b><br>trades is the<br></p><p><b>00:26:59.466 - 00:27:01.566</b><br>fact that you're in safe circles first<br></p><p><b>00:27:01.800 - 00:27:03.000</b><br>and the fact that<br></p><p><b>00:27:03.100 - 00:27:03.800</b><br>there's<br></p><p><b>00:27:03.800 - 00:27:06.966</b><br>such a big argument and such a big scare going on<br></p><p><b>00:27:07.266 - 00:27:10.533</b><br>with Bitcoin cache right now that it was just like<br></p><p><b>00:27:10.766 - 00:27:11.966</b><br>easy pickings<br></p><p><b>00:27:12.200 - 00:27:15.600</b><br>so anyway I got those 18s I got those 21s<br></p><p><b>00:27:15.600 - 00:27:17.366</b><br>and I know you're probably thinking hey<br></p><p><b>00:27:17.366 - 00:27:18.766</b><br>it's all the way up at 29<br></p><p><b>00:27:18.766 - 00:27:20.500</b><br>32 when is loop gonna sell<br></p><p><b>00:27:20.600 - 00:27:22.466</b><br>actually I sold at 26<br></p><p><b>00:27:22.666 - 00:27:23.800</b><br>I sold right here<br></p><p><b>00:27:24.666 - 00:27:25.933</b><br>but you can't see that<br></p><p><b>00:27:26.400 - 00:27:30.900</b><br>Kraken is sucking really bad for submitting orders<br></p><p><b>00:27:31.133 - 00:27:33.700</b><br>I mean it's been like that for a long time<br></p><p><b>00:27:33.766 - 00:27:36.300</b><br>and so this order<br></p><p><b>00:27:36.333 - 00:27:38.566</b><br>and this order and these orders<br></p><p><b>00:27:38.600 - 00:27:41.200</b><br>I put in advance I went and I<br></p><p><b>00:27:41.500 - 00:27:44.666</b><br>you know submitted them through Coin Energy and then<br></p><p><b>00:27:45.566 - 00:27:49.333</b><br>no request denied or this this<br></p><p><b>00:27:50.900 - 00:27:52.333</b><br>order it failed to<br></p><p><b>00:27:52.933 - 00:27:54.700</b><br>transmit or whatever and then I<br></p><p><b>00:27:54.800 - 00:27:56.666</b><br>and then I resubmitted it no<br></p><p><b>00:27:56.666 - 00:27:58.400</b><br>no failure and I resubmitted it<br></p><p><b>00:27:58.400 - 00:28:00.000</b><br>no no failure and I did that<br></p><p><b>00:28:00.000 - 00:28:01.933</b><br>so I was making these orders up<br></p><p><b>00:28:02.066 - 00:28:03.266</b><br>way over here somewhere<br></p><p><b>00:28:03.266 - 00:28:05.266</b><br>I did that for like an hour or something<br></p><p><b>00:28:05.500 - 00:28:07.666</b><br>until I finally got all these orders set up<br></p><p><b>00:28:08.866 - 00:28:10.166</b><br>so that's no problem<br></p><p><b>00:28:10.366 - 00:28:11.966</b><br>because then when it drops really hard<br></p><p><b>00:28:12.533 - 00:28:13.466</b><br>I'm all set up<br></p><p><b>00:28:13.700 - 00:28:16.366</b><br>but this one I needed an execution<br></p><p><b>00:28:16.366 - 00:28:18.600</b><br>by the time it bounced up to around 26<br></p><p><b>00:28:18.700 - 00:28:21.100</b><br>I was like that is lots of profit for me<br></p><p><b>00:28:21.166 - 00:28:24.300</b><br>that's like 45 percent or something profit<br></p><p><b>00:28:24.466 - 00:28:27.333</b><br>that's lots on when you got some size on<br></p><p><b>00:28:27.700 - 00:28:31.100</b><br>so I was really happy with 45 percent profit so I just<br></p><p><b>00:28:31.200 - 00:28:32.466</b><br>I went into<br></p><p><b>00:28:34.333 - 00:28:35.133</b><br>Kraken<br></p><p><b>00:28:35.300 - 00:28:38.600</b><br>and submit the order through them I just forgot about<br></p><p><b>00:28:39.066 - 00:28:40.300</b><br>coin energy and just went into<br></p><p><b>00:28:40.300 - 00:28:41.533</b><br>crack and submit the order<br></p><p><b>00:28:41.666 - 00:28:43.500</b><br>so because of that I don't get<br></p><p><b>00:28:43.766 - 00:28:44.900</b><br>a little red arrow<br></p><p><b>00:28:44.966 - 00:28:46.333</b><br>unfortunately so you guys<br></p><p><b>00:28:46.333 - 00:28:47.866</b><br>are just gonna have to take it for me that I<br></p><p><b>00:28:47.866 - 00:28:51.333</b><br>sold it 26 and I'm not still holding it up here at 32<br></p><p><b>00:28:51.466 - 00:28:52.700</b><br>which would be like<br></p><p><b>00:28:52.800 - 00:28:54.866</b><br>you know I don't know 80 percent<br></p><p><b>00:28:55.900 - 00:28:58.300</b><br>on size that's just insane<br></p><p><b>00:28:59.900 - 00:29:02.200</b><br>liquid exchange oh my goodness I don't even know<br></p><p><b>00:29:02.366 - 00:29:05.266</b><br>what happened with liquid it was just going crazy like<br></p><p><b>00:29:05.333 - 00:29:06.900</b><br>look at the theorem on liquid<br></p><p><b>00:29:07.000 - 00:29:08.800</b><br>see you can see I bought there<br></p><p><b>00:29:08.900 - 00:29:09.933</b><br>which is like the tippity<br></p><p><b>00:29:09.933 - 00:29:12.166</b><br>tip of the bottom of this crazy drop<br></p><p><b>00:29:13.200 - 00:29:14.000</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:29:15.066 - 00:29:16.366</b><br>ethereum wasn't doing anything<br></p><p><b>00:29:16.900 -

00:29:24.766</b><br>so I had to buy it because<br></p><p><b>00:29:25.066 - 00:29:28.000</b><br>you know here it is at $650<br></p><p><b>00:29:28.000 - 00:29:30.900</b><br>and all in all the other exchanges is it's at $800<br></p><p><b>00:29:30.900 - 00:29:31.866</b><br>so I would have just<br></p><p><b>00:29:32.666 - 00:29:34.800</b><br>would have just wired it out you know bought my<br></p><p><b>00:29:34.800 - 00:29:36.800</b><br>Ethereum wired it out to another<br></p><p><b>00:29:37.066 - 00:29:38.900</b><br>broker to another exchange<br></p><p><b>00:29:38.900 - 00:29:41.933</b><br>and just sold it there and made that that arbitrage<br></p><p><b>00:29:41.966 - 00:29:44.166</b><br>but it started bouncing on me so I'm like okay<br></p><p><b>00:29:44.166 - 00:29:45.366</b><br>well let's see what it's gonna do<br></p><p><b>00:29:45.366 - 00:29:48.100</b><br>I and it bounced all the way up back to 800<br></p><p><b>00:29:48.133 - 00:29:51.000</b><br>and I don't know why I don't get my little red arrow<br></p><p><b>00:29:51.100 - 00:29:53.333</b><br>but I sold it up here I was like yeah<br></p><p><b>00:29:54.400 - 00:29:56.966</b><br>once it got to what the other exchanges had<br></p><p><b>00:29:57.166 - 00:29:59.766</b><br>I was like sweet so I just took my profit up here<br></p><p><b>00:30:00.100 - 00:30:01.533</b><br>and then it fell again<br></p><p><b>00:30:01.600 - 00:30:04.100</b><br>and like I mean this is over a two day period but<br></p><p><b>00:30:04.266 - 00:30:06.900</b><br>you know then it fell fell fell fell fell fell fell<br></p><p><b>00:30:07.400 - 00:30:12.000</b><br>and at this point at around 600 and 15 when<br></p><p><b>00:30:12.100 - 00:30:14.566</b><br>all the other brokers were up at 780 or something<br></p><p><b>00:30:14.800 - 00:30:15.666</b><br>I was like okay<br></p><p><b>00:30:15.666 - 00:30:18.333</b><br>I don't know what's going on with the liquid exchange<br></p><p><b>00:30:18.500 - 00:30:20.000</b><br>but I'm wiring out<br></p><p><b>00:30:20.000 - 00:30:21.866</b><br>I just don't want my funds over there<br></p><p><b>00:30:21.900 - 00:30:25.266</b><br>so I rebought here wired out to another<br></p><p><b>00:30:25.866 - 00:30:27.966</b><br>exchange and then took my profits<br></p><p><b>00:30:28.133 - 00:30:30.666</b><br>so this was like huge profits for me<br></p><p><b>00:30:31.000 - 00:30:34.066</b><br>well I mean there wasn't a lot of money over there<br></p><p><b>00:30:34.133 - 00:30:36.533</b><br>at liquid I don't use that exchange very much<br></p><p><b>00:30:36.800 - 00:30:37.800</b><br>but I mean it was huge<br></p><p><b>00:30:37.800 - 00:30:40.200</b><br>percentages on the money that I did have there<br></p><p><b>00:30:40.200 - 00:30:41.566</b><br>and it turned out like now<br></p><p><b>00:30:41.566 - 00:30:43.133</b><br>right now I don't have any over there<br></p><p><b>00:30:43.900 - 00:30:44.800</b><br>because I just wired it out<br></p><p><b>00:30:44.800 - 00:30:46.966</b><br>because look at this craziness of what happened<br></p><p><b>00:30:47.066 - 00:30:48.766</b><br>look at Bitcoin for these guys<br></p><p><b>00:30:49.533 -

00:30:57.766</b><br>you couldn't wire money in<br></p><p><b>00:30:57.900 - 00:30:59.733</b><br>like you couldn't wire USD in<br></p><p><b>00:31:00.666 - 00:31:01.966</b><br>like you can wire tether in<br></p><p><b>00:31:02.133 -

00:31:52.100</b><br>crazy drop where it's not happening on other exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:31:52.133 - 00:31:53.100</b><br>because there's just<br></p><p><b>00:31:53.200 - 00:31:56.266</b><br>barely anybody who's got any USDT on here<br></p><p><b>00:31:56.300 -

00:32:03.166</b><br>and its price<br></p><p><b>00:32:03.166 - 00:32:05.700</b><br>and it's supply and demand and there's just no supply<br></p><p><b>00:32:05.933 - 00:32:06.733</b><br>of tether<br></p><p><b>00:32:08.333 -

00:32:43.866</b><br>whoa that's awesome right<br></p><p><b>00:32:43.866 - 00:32:46.166</b><br>and I even held some and then I sold a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:32:46.166 - 00:32:51.166</b><br>at 525 so this was like beautiful trades in retrospect<br></p><p><b>00:32:51.166 - 00:32:52.133</b><br>it's like what<br></p><p><b>00:32:52.300 - 00:32:53.866</b><br>it went all the way up to 850<br></p><p><b>00:32:54.166 - 00:32:56.400</b><br>so you know and then you're like drawing your bases<br></p><p><b>00:32:56.400 - 00:32:57.066</b><br>you're like okay<br></p><p><b>00:32:57.066 - 00:32:58.000</b><br>if this ever gets broken<br></p><p><b>00:32:58.000 - 00:33:00.533</b><br>I'm gonna be eaten in this safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:33:00.766 - 00:33:01.533</b><br>and then you know<br></p><p><b>00:33:01.533 - 00:33:02.666</b><br>if this ever gets broken<br></p><p><b>00:33:02.666 - 00:33:04.500</b><br>I'm gonna be eaten in this safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:33:04.566 - 00:33:06.000</b><br>and then if this ever gets broken<br></p><p><b>00:33:06.000 - 00:33:07.400</b><br>I'm gonna be eating in this safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:33:07.400 - 00:33:09.000</b><br>and it just never happens for us right<br></p><p><b>00:33:09.466 - 00:33:10.866</b><br>and then all of a sudden it does happen<br></p><p><b>00:33:11.133 - 00:33:13.066</b><br>and so I got some beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:33:13.533 - 00:33:15.933</b><br>566's right here<br></p><p><b>00:33:16.466 -

00:33:30.900</b><br>those were beautiful trades also<br></p><p><b>00:33:31.400 - 00:33:33.866</b><br>so very easy to you know go ahead and<br></p><p><b>00:33:34.000 - 00:33:36.266</b><br>make yourself a base right here somewhere<br></p><p><b>00:33:36.400 -

00:33:56.400</b><br>if it gets anywhere in the 1100s<br></p><p><b>00:33:56.466 - 00:33:58.266</b><br>I mean I will be buying<br></p><p><b>00:33:58.700 - 00:34:02.333</b><br>I would call a base if I was stuck to call a base here<br></p><p><b>00:34:03.366 - 00:34:05.400</b><br>I'd be calling my base right here<br></p><p><b>00:34:05.400 - 00:34:07.366</b><br>somewhere in the 1150 area<br></p><p><b>00:34:07.666 - 00:34:09.133</b><br>if it breaks this<br></p><p><b>00:34:09.466 -

00:34:21.500</b><br>wish I could make that circle a little bit nicer<br></p><p><b>00:34:21.800 - 00:34:25.733</b><br>this circle right here from 1150 down to 9000 is<br></p><p><b>00:34:26.133 - 00:34:28.266</b><br>is prime that is where<br></p><p><b>00:34:28.400 - 00:34:29.933</b><br>I want to get size<br></p><p><b>00:34:29.966 - 00:34:32.000</b><br>if it manages to crack through that<br></p><p><b>00:34:32.000 - 00:34:34.166</b><br>there is going to be a major panic<br></p><p><b>00:34:34.300 - 00:34:38.100</b><br>and you know that crack of 1150 11<br></p><p><b>00:34:38.533 - 00:34:41.733</b><br>that crack would make one huge panic<br></p><p><b>00:34:41.766 - 00:34:43.600</b><br>and if it got anywhere near 9<br></p><p><b>00:34:43.600 - 00:34:45.333</b><br>you are going to get a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:34:45.333 - 00:34:48.800</b><br>it will not I mean I can't predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:34:49.066 - 00:34:52.766</b><br>but the chances of it cracking 1150<br></p><p><b>00:34:53.000 - 00:34:55.266</b><br>and getting past 9000<br></p><p><b>00:34:55.900 - 00:35:00.566</b><br>is almost impossible unconceivable without a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:35:00.600 - 00:35:01.600</b><br>like it can bounce<br></p><p><b>00:35:01.600 - 00:35:04.000</b><br>it can go down to 9,000 bounce back up to 11<br></p><p><b>00:35:05.000 - 00:35:07.933</b><br>or 1150 you know back to its previous base<br></p><p><b>00:35:07.933 - 00:35:09.300</b><br>and then continue to fall<br></p><p><b>00:35:09.300 - 00:35:11.300</b><br>crack and continue to fall another panic and<br></p><p><b>00:35:11.300 - 00:35:12.333</b><br>just keep on doing that<br></p><p><b>00:35:13.100 - 00:35:16.666</b><br>but for it to crack two major bases<br></p><p><b>00:35:17.200 - 00:35:19.133</b><br>would be insane<br></p><p><b>00:35:19.300 - 00:35:21.300</b><br>if it got past 9000<br></p><p><b>00:35:22.600 - 00:35:24.566</b><br>I bet the house I<br></p><p><b>00:35:25.100 - 00:35:26.133</b><br>take whatever<br></p><p><b>00:35:26.133 - 00:35:29.266</b><br>money I have from every location and buy<br></p><p><b>00:35:29.266 - 00:35:30.933</b><br>everything I could possibly buy<br></p><p><b>00:35:31.700 - 00:35:33.066</b><br>that would be the panic of all panics<br></p><p><b>00:35:33.066 - 00:35:35.100</b><br>but the juicy spot really is<br></p><p><b>00:35:35.766 - 00:35:38.466</b><br>somewhere from 1150 down to 9000<br></p><p><b>00:35:38.766 - 00:35:41.100</b><br>buying in that range is like a really great<br></p><p><b>00:35:41.100 - 00:35:43.700</b><br>place to buy if it can crack those 11ths<br></p><p><b>00:35:45.066 - 00:35:47.000</b><br>okay so the last thing I want to talk to you guys about<br></p><p><b>00:35:47.133 - 00:35:48.366</b><br>tonight is this<br></p><p><b>00:35:48.600 - 00:35:49.600</b><br>standard that we have<br></p><p><b>00:35:50.100 - 00:35:52.700</b><br>it's an app and it's available on<br></p><p><b>00:35:53.133 - 00:35:55.400</b><br>Android and on apple<br></p><p><b>00:35:55.700 - 00:35:57.766</b><br>phones and it's called the Cryptobase scanner<br></p><p><b>00:35:57.766 - 00:35:59.133</b><br>and I mentioned it in my last<br></p><p><b>00:35:59.133 - 00:36:01.333</b><br>video that I've been using it every day and testing it<br></p><p><b>00:36:01.800 - 00:36:04.866</b><br>the creator his name is Benoist<br></p><p><b>00:36:05.733 - 00:36:06.533</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:36:06.566 - 00:36:09.266</b><br>and he's put a lot of work on this like over 100 hours<br></p><p><b>00:36:09.266 - 00:36:10.133</b><br>working on this<br></p><p><b>00:36:10.200 - 00:36:12.200</b><br>and so I want to talk about<br></p><p><b>00:36:12.200 - 00:36:13.333</b><br>the good things and the bad things<br></p><p><b>00:36:13.333 - 00:36:14.600</b><br>so let me explain first<br></p><p><b>00:36:14.866 - 00:36:18.100</b><br>how what this what this app does<br></p><p><b>00:36:18.266 - 00:36:19.900</b><br>so let me switch pages<br></p><p><b>00:36:20.266 - 00:36:22.500</b><br>so right here presently right now<br></p><p><b>00:36:23.366 - 00:36:24.200</b><br>you will see<br></p><p><b>00:36:24.333 - 00:36:26.700</b><br>that this is your first pig when you open up the app<br></p><p><b>00:36:26.733 - 00:36:28.700</b><br>and you've got the broken basis<br></p><p><b>00:36:28.866 - 00:36:30.133</b><br>and you have markets<br></p><p><b>00:36:30.133 - 00:36:31.733</b><br>so you can choose which markets you want<br></p><p><b>00:36:31.733 - 00:36:33.133</b><br>but I think right now<br></p><p><b>00:36:33.500 - 00:36:35.466</b><br>it might be just bittracks that<br></p><p><b>00:36:35.933 - 00:36:37.400</b><br>comes on the markets and measure<br></p><p><b>00:36:37.400 - 00:36:38.666</b><br>and then settings right<br></p><p><b>00:36:38.666 - 00:36:39.800</b><br>so you got just three<br></p><p><b>00:36:39.800 - 00:36:41.800</b><br>things that you can pick from three headers<br></p><p><b>00:36:41.900 - 00:36:44.966</b><br>and then underneath here is what's happening right now<br></p><p><b>00:36:45.566 - 00:36:47.333</b><br>in the market and they'll say that this<br></p><p><b>00:36:48.666 - 00:36:51.500</b><br>NBT has dropped 5%<br></p><p><b>00:36:52.366 - 00:36:53.666</b><br>below its base right<br></p><p><b>00:36:53.666 - 00:36:55.400</b><br>so let's say we were to click on this<br></p><p><b>00:36:55.400 - 00:36:58.733</b><br>and I can't put the app here on the computer so I<br></p><p><b>00:36:58.800 - 00:37:00.600</b><br>have to just go with screenshots<br></p><p><b>00:37:00.600 - 00:37:02.866</b><br>so let's click on this and see what that shows<br></p><p><b>00:37:03.600 - 00:37:05.533</b><br>so here it pulls you up a chart<br></p><p><b>00:37:05.900 - 00:37:09.466</b><br>and so it'll tell you that it's dropped 4.5%<br></p><p><b>00:37:09.766 - 00:37:10.900</b><br>it'll tell you where<br></p><p><b>00:37:10.933 - 00:37:12.800</b><br>the computer his algorithm<br></p><p><b>00:37:12.800 - 00:37:14.600</b><br>his computer has picked a base<br></p><p><b>00:37:14.600 - 00:37:16.766</b><br>so he's picked a base of 7 need2<br></p><p><b>00:37:17.666 - 00:37:19.333</b><br>which actually looks really good<br></p><p><b>00:37:19.333 - 00:37:22.200</b><br>right 72 that's a pretty clear base<br></p><p><b>00:37:23.366 - 00:37:28.766</b><br>so base of 72 and the price is dropped down to 68.68<br></p><p><b>00:37:29.300 - 00:37:30.100</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:37:30.500 - 00:37:33.300</b><br>you can you get a nice clear chart<br></p><p><b>00:37:33.300 - 00:37:35.000</b><br>and you can just use your fingers to<br></p><p><b>00:37:35.000 - 00:37:36.000</b><br>enlarge that chart<br></p><p><b>00:37:36.000 -

00:40:30.266</b><br>but that's just<br></p><p><b>00:40:30.266 - 00:40:33.933</b><br>so the idea is awesome the app works awesome<br></p><p><b>00:40:34.066 - 00:40:35.600</b><br>the only problem is<br></p><p><b>00:40:35.733 - 00:40:37.700</b><br>and I also love that you can just<br></p><p><b>00:40:37.700 - 00:40:39.466</b><br>click on it and check the chart and be like<br></p><p><b>00:40:39.466 - 00:40:41.400</b><br>oh yeah and I know for me<br></p><p><b>00:40:42.300 - 00:40:43.966</b><br>for me when I look at this chart<br></p><p><b>00:40:44.100 - 00:40:46.300</b><br>I would just draw the basis like I'd<br></p><p><b>00:40:46.300 - 00:40:47.766</b><br>blow this picture up a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:40:48.100 - 00:40:51.800</b><br>and I'd be like okay here's a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:40:52.533 - 00:40:53.333</b><br>yeah nothing<br></p><p><b>00:40:53.333 - 00:40:54.566</b><br>actually nothing came you little but<br></p><p><b>00:40:54.566 - 00:40:55.533</b><br>there's a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:40:55.533 - 00:40:57.266</b><br>and yeah it was respected<br></p><p><b>00:40:57.266 - 00:40:59.000</b><br>and you go back in the past<br></p><p><b>00:40:59.500 - 00:41:01.266</b><br>over here you're not getting much to go off with<br></p><p><b>00:41:01.266 - 00:41:03.733</b><br>maybe right there you might have called a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:41:03.733 - 00:41:05.166</b><br>and that was respected<br></p><p><b>00:41:05.166 - 00:41:06.266</b><br>and right there you<br></p><p><b>00:41:06.333 - 00:41:08.566</b><br>call a clear base and that was respected<br></p><p><b>00:41:08.566 - 00:41:10.533</b><br>so you've got three to look at<br></p><p><b>00:41:10.700 - 00:41:14.400</b><br>so you'd have to get a better picture of this chart<br></p><p><b>00:41:15.066 - 00:41:17.133</b><br>but the idea is awesome<br></p><p><b>00:41:17.166 - 00:41:18.766</b><br>the app works great<br></p><p><b>00:41:18.900 - 00:41:22.366</b><br>and you can physically soon as you get an alert<br></p><p><b>00:41:22.533 - 00:41:24.200</b><br>either disqualify it and say<br></p><p><b>00:41:24.200 - 00:41:26.000</b><br>okay no I don't agree with that base<br></p><p><b>00:41:26.100 - 00:41:27.933</b><br>or go check all the basis<br></p><p><b>00:41:27.933 - 00:41:29.066</b><br>because it's right in your hand<br></p><p><b>00:41:29.100 - 00:41:30.600</b><br>you don't even have to go look anything up<br></p><p><b>00:41:30.600 - 00:41:31.766</b><br>you got the chart<br></p><p><b>00:41:31.966 - 00:41:35.200</b><br>so because of those things I really like this<br></p><p><b>00:41:35.200 - 00:41:35.900</b><br>plus<br></p><p><b>00:41:35.900 - 00:41:39.166</b><br>I always want to encourage the development of tools<br></p><p><b>00:41:39.333 - 00:41:41.766</b><br>because these tools are so helpful for us<br></p><p><b>00:41:42.266 - 00:41:44.866</b><br>now just looking back at the page before this<br></p><p><b>00:41:45.000 - 00:41:47.066</b><br>where we were looking at this thing and we said<br></p><p><b>00:41:47.066 - 00:41:48.500</b><br>you know it's down 5%<br></p><p><b>00:41:48.500 - 00:41:50.100</b><br>and then we were clicking on this button<br></p><p><b>00:41:50.100 - 00:41:51.966</b><br>it took us to the page that we saw the chart<br></p><p><b>00:41:52.533 - 00:41:54.200</b><br>there's also a little arrow right here<br></p><p><b>00:41:54.200 - 00:41:55.266</b><br>that you can click<br></p><p><b>00:41:55.366 - 00:41:57.300</b><br>to change your settings a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:41:57.300 - 00:41:58.566</b><br>and I'll show you that in a second<br></p><p><b>00:41:58.566 - 00:42:00.533</b><br>and there's also the past 24 hours<br></p><p><b>00:42:00.533 - 00:42:03.566</b><br>whatever bases got cracked within the past 24 hours<br></p><p><b>00:42:03.566 - 00:42:04.900</b><br>that the computer has found<br></p><p><b>00:42:05.000 - 00:42:08.333</b><br>so let's pretend we click on this and see what happens<br></p><p><b>00:42:08.900 - 00:42:09.733</b><br>so you click on that thing<br></p><p><b>00:42:09.733 - 00:42:11.266</b><br>and you get a little scrolly bar<br></p><p><b>00:42:11.500 - 00:42:14.100</b><br>and you get to pick how much volume<br></p><p><b>00:42:14.566 - 00:42:16.500</b><br>you know you want how much daily volume and<br></p><p><b>00:42:16.566 - 00:42:18.166</b><br>the percentage below the base<br></p><p><b>00:42:18.166 - 00:42:18.400</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:42:18.400 - 00:42:20.766</b><br>maybe you don't want to get any alerts until it's like<br></p><p><b>00:42:20.900 - 00:42:22.600</b><br>10 percent below a base<br></p><p><b>00:42:22.766 - 00:42:24.533</b><br>and then you can just qualify it<br></p><p><b>00:42:24.533 - 00:42:26.733</b><br>like I said by looking at the chart and saying yeah<br></p><p><b>00:42:26.733 - 00:42:27.900</b><br>I believe that is a base<br></p><p><b>00:42:27.900 - 00:42:30.000</b><br>and maybe blowing it up a little bit and being like<br></p><p><b>00:42:30.066 - 00:42:32.366</b><br>respected respected respected respect<br></p><p><b>00:42:32.366 - 00:42:34.366</b><br>oh okay this is a good one for me<br></p><p><b>00:42:35.000 - 00:42:37.400</b><br>but I would say for now that<br></p><p><b>00:42:38.000 - 00:42:39.600</b><br>little section that says<br></p><p><b>00:42:40.066 - 00:42:41.933</b><br>percentage of bases respected<br></p><p><b>00:42:42.500 - 00:42:43.900</b><br>it's not really accurate yet<br></p><p><b>00:42:45.000 -

00:44:24.466</b><br>you know to making it and to maintaining it<br></p><p><b>00:44:24.466 - 00:44:25.733</b><br>and then he's going to keep working on it<br></p><p><b>00:44:25.733 - 00:44:26.366</b><br>to make it better<br></p><p><b>00:44:26.366 - 00:44:29.500</b><br>so that just it takes money and he said that<br></p><p><b>00:44:30.066 - 00:44:32.133</b><br>also in his message to me<br></p><p><b>00:44:33.966 - 00:44:36.266</b><br>he said that the price might get lowered<br></p><p><b>00:44:36.700 - 00:44:39.600</b><br>if the server capacity per user can be reduced<br></p><p><b>00:44:39.666 - 00:44:40.466</b><br>you know and it<br></p><p><b>00:44:40.600 - 00:44:42.500</b><br>is not something he can predict right now<br></p><p><b>00:44:43.600 - 00:44:47.533</b><br>so do I like this app do I use this app yeah I do<br></p><p><b>00:44:48.100 - 00:44:50.800</b><br>I like having the charts on my phone<br></p><p><b>00:44:50.900 - 00:44:52.566</b><br>I like getting alerts that<br></p><p><b>00:44:52.566 - 00:44:54.400</b><br>something that might be a base crack<br></p><p><b>00:44:54.400 - 00:44:55.800</b><br>they're not all base cracks<br></p><p><b>00:44:55.800 - 00:44:57.400</b><br>I don't agree with all the bases<br></p><p><b>00:44:57.400 - 00:44:58.866</b><br>but I like getting the alerts anyway<br></p><p><b>00:44:58.866 - 00:45:01.500</b><br>I like getting the false alerts too because<br></p><p><b>00:45:01.800 - 00:45:03.733</b><br>you know I want to I want to catch<br></p><p><b>00:45:03.733 - 00:45:07.400</b><br>I want to broad net I want to catch whatever I can do I<br></p><p><b>00:45:07.866 - 00:45:11.166</b><br>trust the base's respected thing<br></p><p><b>00:45:11.166 - 00:45:12.900</b><br>no but it's a great idea<br></p><p><b>00:45:13.466 - 00:45:16.400</b><br>so I encourage him to keep developing that<br></p><p><b>00:45:16.766 - 00:45:20.000</b><br>and yeah I use the app I like the app<br></p><p><b>00:45:20.300 - 00:45:21.600</b><br>and but<br></p><p><b>00:45:22.266 - 00:45:24.266</b><br>I mean teach their own<br></p><p><b>00:45:24.266 - 00:45:27.300</b><br>and you definitely don't need it to make money<br></p></body></html>
