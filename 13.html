00:00:06.933</b><br>more close to<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.766 - 00:00:09.100</b><br>I've had a rough morning<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.100 - 00:00:11.966</b><br>oh I woke up with migraine headache this morning just<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.966 - 00:00:12.800</b><br>chillin me<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.600 - 00:00:15.366</b><br>and then I had a position<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.366 - 00:00:18.400</b><br>from Friday that I bought in on the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.800 - 00:00:20.100</b><br>so I was just ready to<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.100 - 00:00:22.533</b><br>give it on Monday and my broker goes down<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.133 - 00:00:26.566</b><br>so I'm like watching this thing climb without me<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.866 - 00:00:29.533</b><br>I can't sell and I'm on the phone<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.533 - 00:00:31.733</b><br>and when you get on the phone with your broker<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.566 - 00:00:36.000</b><br>it can take a long time before you actually get through<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.000 - 00:00:37.466</b><br>because when their system goes down<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.466 - 00:00:38.766</b><br>everybody's calling in<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.766 - 00:00:40.066</b><br>and so yeah<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.133 -

00:00:46.866</b><br>some money so I'm pretty happy with that but<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.133 - 00:00:51.533</b><br>the broke reaches down so I can't continue trading so<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.733 - 00:00:53.133</b><br>I figured I'd just take a<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.133 - 00:00:54.700</b><br>few minutes to make you guys a video<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.133 - 00:00:57.500</b><br>like I do most most days<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.200 - 00:01:00.766</b><br>I've had lots of questions that we can discuss<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.566 - 00:01:04.000</b><br>people are really interested to talk about<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.666 - 00:01:07.000</b><br>growing a small account and using those<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.300 - 00:01:08.900</b><br>really big percentage<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.700 -

00:01:22.600</b><br>a quick video for you guys because<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.600 - 00:01:23.600</b><br>look at what's happening with<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.600 - 00:01:24.266</b><br>Ethereum right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.266 -

00:01:34.100</b><br>so they like me to draw in<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.100 - 00:01:36.100</b><br>you know the base<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.366 - 00:01:39.400</b><br>and then make a nice save circle<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.766 - 00:01:43.500</b><br>and another save circle and then you draw in your base<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.200 - 00:01:46.166</b><br>and you make you save circle<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.100 - 00:01:47.500</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.500 - 00:01:49.700</b><br>I don't know that seems all pretty obvious to me<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.700 - 00:01:52.100</b><br>but I guess I guess everybody's<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.600 - 00:01:53.400</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.700 - 00:01:55.700</b><br>feeling nervous about taking their first few trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.700 - 00:01:56.466</b><br>especially if they're<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.466 - 00:01:57.700</b><br>if they're new trading<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.500 - 00:02:00.500</b><br>so you know it's<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.600 - 00:02:01.766</b><br>here you can see the same circles<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.766 - 00:02:03.600</b><br>but they're asking me where do you sell<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.733 - 00:02:04.533</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.400 - 00:02:07.000</b><br>anywhere in a profit is good<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.166 - 00:02:08.866</b><br>it's all good like look at here<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.066 - 00:02:11.366</b><br>I nibbled I nibbled I got a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.733 - 00:02:12.900</b><br>actually I sold it there<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.300 - 00:02:15.333</b><br>but I nibbled I nibbled I sold<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.666 - 00:02:19.933</b><br>then I bought pretty good I think right here and I sold<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.166 - 00:02:22.466</b><br>and then look I didn't wait for it to crack this base<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.466 - 00:02:23.900</b><br>I nibbled again right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.066 - 00:02:26.000</b><br>and then I sold and then I sold<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.900 - 00:02:29.333</b><br>so like you know you'd think<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.333 - 00:02:32.000</b><br>well Luke wait aren't you breaking your own rules<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.000 - 00:02:33.933</b><br>you just you just bought a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.133 - 00:02:36.766</b><br>well no because this was my real buy<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.000 - 00:02:38.600</b><br>and this was just a nibble<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.666 - 00:02:41.133</b><br>you know because I'm like oh is it gonna crack<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.133 - 00:02:44.200</b><br>and I'm so used to seeing all of these patterns<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.800 - 00:02:46.466</b><br>that's why sometimes I don't like<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.466 - 00:02:48.333</b><br>having my little arrows on the screen<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.366 - 00:02:50.100</b><br>because I don't want to confuse everybody<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.200 - 00:02:52.600</b><br>because the safe circle is really this right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.600 - 00:02:55.300</b><br>this is the safe circle and this is the safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.466 - 00:02:57.200</b><br>and over here this is the safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.066 - 00:02:59.933</b><br>this is me just<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.466 - 00:03:01.333</b><br>messing around<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.666 - 00:03:03.400</b><br>and this is just me messing around<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.566 - 00:03:04.533</b><br>you know like I'm just<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.533 - 00:03:07.766</b><br>taking little tiny nibbles just because I loved trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.900 - 00:03:09.966</b><br>and so I'm playing around but<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.066 - 00:03:12.666</b><br>the safe circles that's where<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.700 - 00:03:14.766</b><br>you know I get in actual sizes<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.766 - 00:03:17.066</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.000 - 00:03:20.400</b><br>okay so this is a subject that we should really cover<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.166 - 00:03:21.866</b><br>let me just<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.866 - 00:03:24.266</b><br>pause the video because I can take a drink and just<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.466 - 00:03:26.066</b><br>hold my head for like two seconds<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.066 - 00:03:27.000</b><br>I'll come right back<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.366 - 00:03:31.933</b><br>okay so a subject that we should discuss is<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.133 - 00:03:35.300</b><br>trading like a professional and not emotionally<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.766 - 00:03:38.666</b><br>and you see all these dives<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.766 - 00:03:40.533</b><br>they're emotional dives<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.533 - 00:03:42.966</b><br>this is because this dive right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.466 - 00:03:45.500</b><br>all the way down to there is because<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.966 - 00:03:49.800</b><br>everybody thought man this thing's not going below 200<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.166 - 00:03:52.500</b><br>right suck going below 200<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.966 - 00:03:55.166</b><br>it's probably not going below 225<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.166 - 00:03:56.933</b><br>or whatever the base was here<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.500 - 00:04:00.733</b><br>and when it cracks that everybody panics<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.800 - 00:04:02.600</b><br>and that's why I call it a panic dive right<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.600 - 00:04:04.100</b><br>because they're all panicking<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.166 - 00:04:07.900</b><br>they're all basing their decision now on emotions<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.100 - 00:04:10.533</b><br>they're worried they're like this thing could go to 100<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.533 - 00:04:11.900</b><br>I got to get out now<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.200 - 00:04:13.400</b><br>and they're panicking<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.900 - 00:04:14.700</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.933 - 00:04:17.266</b><br>that's emotional trading<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.100 - 00:04:22.133</b><br>and lots of new traders who are first trading<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.166 - 00:04:25.300</b><br>you know will come onto a chart like here let's try to<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.300 - 00:04:26.366</b><br>let's get rid of these<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.566 - 00:04:27.600</b><br>circles and stuff<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.900 - 00:04:29.533</b><br>and let's give me a<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.000 - 00:04:31.300</b><br>thing and let's back this up<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.733 - 00:04:33.333</b><br>they'll come onto a chart and they'll look at<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.333 - 00:04:34.933</b><br>this much of the chart right<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.966 - 00:04:36.400</b><br>so they're looking first off<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.400 - 00:04:37.600</b><br>they're looking at too small<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.600 - 00:04:39.100</b><br>of a time frame<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.366 - 00:04:41.566</b><br>and then you know they're drawing their base<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.566 - 00:04:42.466</b><br>which would be great<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.466 - 00:04:45.333</b><br>this is a great base to draw right here this is fine<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.866 - 00:04:48.666</b><br>and they're saying okay if it goes underneath 170 ish<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.766 - 00:04:49.800</b><br>I'm going to buy<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.000 - 00:04:51.766</b><br>and then they're buying it 167<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.066 - 00:04:52.866</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.933 - 00:04:55.766</b><br>they're so excited about the crack and they're so<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.800 - 00:04:57.700</b><br>nervous and anxious to get into the position<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.700 - 00:04:59.100</b><br>that they're just buying this<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.100 - 00:05:01.000</b><br>this 167<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.533 - 00:05:03.500</b><br>or they're buying one 65 or<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.900 - 00:05:05.133</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.533 - 00:05:09.000</b><br>they're buying right there one one 57 and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.000 - 00:05:11.333</b><br>they're buying really actually one 57 would be too bad<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.333 - 00:05:12.566</b><br>but they're buying<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.666 - 00:05:16.066</b><br>pretty close to underneath the crack right instead of<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.733 - 00:05:22.200</b><br>scrolling out and seeing the whole story<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.600 - 00:05:26.300</b><br>and then making decisions based on that<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.300 - 00:05:28.133</b><br>let me put us back into real time here<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.166 - 00:05:31.300</b><br>so seeing the whole story and saying okay look<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.300 - 00:05:33.200</b><br>every time this thing drops<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.066 - 00:05:36.566</b><br>it falls that long<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.133 - 00:05:38.666</b><br>it falls that long<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.666 - 00:05:40.266</b><br>before it made a little bounce to there<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.700 - 00:05:42.300</b><br>it falls that long<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.766 - 00:05:44.266</b><br>it falls that long<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.466 - 00:05:45.933</b><br>it falls that long<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.133 - 00:05:47.900</b><br>I'm not even going with cracks I'm just<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.000 - 00:05:49.200</b><br>when people panic<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.333 - 00:05:53.400</b><br>how far does this thing usually fall right<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.533 - 00:05:55.700</b><br>so you can take all those lines and be like okay<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.700 - 00:05:57.166</b><br>it usually falls about that long<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.166 - 00:05:57.566</b><br>I mean<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.566 - 00:06:00.300</b><br>there's not really too much science behind there right<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.566 - 00:06:02.800</b><br>so when it cracks<br></p><p><b>00:06:03.266 - 00:06:06.333</b><br>this this low well you kind of want to fall that long<br></p><p><b>00:06:07.133 - 00:06:08.333</b><br>and so that's why<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.333 - 00:06:10.266</b><br>you don't buy here or here here you can<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.266 - 00:06:11.000</b><br>you can nibble<br></p><p><b>00:06:11.000 - 00:06:12.333</b><br>I always say go ahead and nibble<br></p><p><b>00:06:12.333 - 00:06:13.000</b><br>if you're thinking that<br></p><p><b>00:06:13.000 - 00:06:14.533</b><br>it's just not going to go any further<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.766 - 00:06:15.966</b><br>at least you're participating<br></p><p><b>00:06:15.966 - 00:06:18.133</b><br>and you're feeding that beast<br></p><p><b>00:06:18.500 - 00:06:21.600</b><br>the desire to trade you're at least feeding that<br></p><p><b>00:06:21.800 - 00:06:23.800</b><br>because you're anxious and you're nervous and<br></p><p><b>00:06:23.900 -

00:06:57.733</b><br>right around here here's the base<br></p><p><b>00:06:57.900 - 00:06:58.933</b><br>okay I want to buy here<br></p><p><b>00:06:59.466 - 00:07:00.366</b><br>that's where I want to buy<br></p><p><b>00:07:00.366 - 00:07:00.966</b><br>so they<br></p><p><b>00:07:00.966 - 00:07:05.533</b><br>set their orders up at you know 150 and 140 and 130<br></p><p><b>00:07:05.666 - 00:07:06.333</b><br>because they're like<br></p><p><b>00:07:06.333 - 00:07:09.166</b><br>at that point if people's emotions have run far<br></p><p><b>00:07:09.166 - 00:07:10.400</b><br>enough to make them start to give<br></p><p><b>00:07:10.400 - 00:07:11.900</b><br>away their shares at that point<br></p><p><b>00:07:12.466 - 00:07:13.366</b><br>I want them<br></p><p><b>00:07:13.766 - 00:07:16.933</b><br>and then here's another thing to think about right now<br></p><p><b>00:07:17.400 - 00:07:19.866</b><br>so this thing hit a low of 135<br></p><p><b>00:07:20.166 - 00:07:23.300</b><br>right the new base let me draw that a little nicer<br></p><p><b>00:07:24.700 - 00:07:26.100</b><br>the new base is 135<br></p><p><b>00:07:26.500 - 00:07:29.933</b><br>well that sounds insane we were at 400 the other day<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.500 - 00:07:32.933</b><br>so okay we were at 400 the other day<br></p><p><b>00:07:32.966 - 00:07:34.166</b><br>Luke's been making<br></p><p><b>00:07:35.066 - 00:07:38.066</b><br>free coins profits off of this thing<br></p><p><b>00:07:38.700 -

00:07:56.500</b><br>and it's just because you don't think emotionally<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.500 - 00:07:59.733</b><br>so right now at 135<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.133 - 00:08:01.333</b><br>that sounds insane<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.333 - 00:08:03.733</b><br>like 400 and now it's 135<br></p><p><b>00:08:03.733 - 00:08:07.500</b><br>could it possibly go any lower than 135<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.000 - 00:08:09.266</b><br>like come on<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.266 - 00:08:11.333</b><br>it's got to turn around and start heading back up to<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.333 - 00:08:12.500</b><br>300 soon right<br></p><p><b>00:08:12.500 - 00:08:13.300</b><br>I mean<br></p><p><b>00:08:13.966 -

00:08:23.000</b><br>obviously it's got to be worth more than 135<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.133 - 00:08:26.733</b><br>why don't we just buy it here and hold it well<br></p><p><b>00:08:29.200 - 00:08:32.866</b><br>the chart says the new base is 135<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.900 -

00:13:51.766</b><br>then just start selling<br></p><p><b>00:13:52.266 - 00:13:54.733</b><br>you know like if it bounce and you're in profit<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.933 - 00:13:56.100</b><br>but just sell a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:13:56.466 -

00:14:16.800</b><br>then who cares<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.800 - 00:14:18.400</b><br>just let it that's like free<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.566 - 00:14:19.533</b><br>it's free Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.533 -

00:14:32.200</b><br>you know what let me give you one last example<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.466 - 00:14:34.500</b><br>of where to sell<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.500 - 00:14:37.566</b><br>because last night I made a treat on fun<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.566 - 00:14:38.666</b><br>I was just looking at this<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.766 - 00:14:40.700</b><br>Ethereum USD and right underneath this fun<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.700 - 00:14:42.533</b><br>and I just made a treat on it last night<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.400 - 00:14:45.366</b><br>so let's just take a look at that<br></p><p><b>00:14:47.066 - 00:14:49.266</b><br>all right so here's my trade so<br></p><p><b>00:14:51.100 - 00:14:53.800</b><br>you know this has lots of bases that you can draw right<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.800 - 00:14:55.333</b><br>you can draw a base I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.333 - 00:14:56.766</b><br>where is my thing right there<br></p><p><b>00:14:57.000 - 00:14:58.900</b><br>so you can draw a base over here for sure<br></p><p><b>00:14:58.900 - 00:15:00.333</b><br>right there's a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:15:00.333 - 00:15:03.366</b><br>but look at the bounce that happened off of this base<br></p><p><b>00:15:03.466 - 00:15:04.933</b><br>you know that's a clear base too<br></p><p><b>00:15:05.933 - 00:15:07.933</b><br>and this is a clear base up here too<br></p><p><b>00:15:08.733 - 00:15:10.100</b><br>so you could<br></p><p><b>00:15:10.100 - 00:15:11.666</b><br>you could be buying off of this base<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.666 - 00:15:13.366</b><br>because that was a really nice balance right<br></p><p><b>00:15:13.366 - 00:15:14.566</b><br>what defines the base<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.566 - 00:15:16.366</b><br>the balance that happens off of it<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.400 - 00:15:18.300</b><br>so this was a really clear balance<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.400 - 00:15:20.300</b><br>and this was a really clear balance<br></p><p><b>00:15:20.300 - 00:15:21.800</b><br>and this was a really clear balance<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.100 - 00:15:23.400</b><br>so you can trade off any of those<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.400 - 00:15:26.300</b><br>well I decided to trade off this one because I<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.966 - 00:15:28.933</b><br>you know this was only grinding down slow<br></p><p><b>00:15:28.933 - 00:15:30.733</b><br>it didn't look so panicky to me<br></p><p><b>00:15:31.100 - 00:15:34.100</b><br>so I set up some waters like right here<br></p><p><b>00:15:34.100 - 00:15:35.733</b><br>well you see them all right there right there<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.733 - 00:15:36.666</b><br>right there right there right there<br></p><p><b>00:15:36.666 - 00:15:37.766</b><br>and to infinity<br></p><p><b>00:15:37.766 - 00:15:39.866</b><br>I set up a whole bunch of orders<br></p><p><b>00:15:40.400 - 00:15:43.066</b><br>and then I got a spike down all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:15:43.800 - 00:15:45.100</b><br>you know ding ding ding ding<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.100 - 00:15:49.066</b><br>I think my alerts go off and I just bought you know<br></p><p><b>00:15:49.700 - 00:15:55.733</b><br>44 42 40 38 and instantly<br></p><p><b>00:15:56.000 - 00:15:59.700</b><br>like like I mean instant I mean within a minute<br></p><p><b>00:16:00.066 - 00:16:01.766</b><br>it was back up at 48<br></p><p><b>00:16:01.966 - 00:16:04.000</b><br>where I sold right there see my little red dot<br></p><p><b>00:16:04.200 - 00:16:06.766</b><br>so you know here I am buying 38<br></p><p><b>00:16:06.933 - 00:16:10.766</b><br>40 42 and selling them all at 48<br></p><p><b>00:16:10.800 - 00:16:12.866</b><br>well look what happened it went all the way up to 62<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.200 - 00:16:16.700</b><br>now am I crying about it going all the way up to 62<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.166 - 00:16:20.100</b><br>should I have saved some to sell up us<br></p><p><b>00:16:20.100 - 00:16:22.533</b><br>I just got a gift within a minute<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.600 - 00:16:25.133</b><br>I got a huge percentage trade<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.333 - 00:16:26.133</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:16:26.900 - 00:16:28.733</b><br>it didn't bother me at all to celebrate there<br></p><p><b>00:16:28.733 - 00:16:29.700</b><br>that's what I'm saying to you<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.700 - 00:16:32.300</b><br>anywhere for profit you're doing<br></p><p><b>00:16:32.900 - 00:16:36.600</b><br>it right now I could have analyzed this chart and said<br></p><p><b>00:16:36.933 - 00:16:39.500</b><br>okay there was a clear base right here<br></p><p><b>00:16:39.766 - 00:16:41.933</b><br>so obviously if<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.266 - 00:16:44.533</b><br>this is my save circle<br></p><p><b>00:16:44.533 - 00:16:45.800</b><br>all of this is my save circle<br></p><p><b>00:16:45.800 - 00:16:46.733</b><br>because it's going to probably<br></p><p><b>00:16:46.733 - 00:16:48.766</b><br>come back and retouch the space<br></p><p><b>00:16:48.766 - 00:16:49.566</b><br>which it did<br></p><p><b>00:16:50.500 - 00:16:51.366</b><br>see so<br></p><p><b>00:16:53.066 - 00:16:54.200</b><br>that's how it works<br></p><p><b>00:16:54.500 - 00:16:55.466</b><br>but I didn't do that<br></p><p><b>00:16:55.466 - 00:16:56.100</b><br>I got it<br></p><p><b>00:16:56.100 - 00:16:59.733</b><br>a quick trade an easy trade a high percentage trade<br></p><p><b>00:16:59.733 - 00:17:02.500</b><br>it took a fast bike<br></p><p><b>00:17:02.500 - 00:17:04.266</b><br>and came back up to the original base<br></p><p><b>00:17:04.266 - 00:17:06.300</b><br>that I was basing my trade off of<br></p><p><b>00:17:07.066 - 00:17:08.300</b><br>and to my products<br></p><p><b>00:17:10.300 - 00:17:11.466</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:17:13.966 - 00:17:15.766</b><br>everybody wants to talk to me about<br></p><p><b>00:17:15.766 - 00:17:17.600</b><br>everybody's asking on<br></p><p><b>00:17:17.700 - 00:17:18.733</b><br>steam it about<br></p><p><b>00:17:19.400 - 00:17:21.466</b><br>taking small accounts making them bigger<br></p><p><b>00:17:21.466 - 00:17:22.700</b><br>because I mentioned<br></p><p><b>00:17:22.900 - 00:17:24.266</b><br>a video or two back<br></p><p><b>00:17:24.400 - 00:17:25.533</b><br>that sometimes you can<br></p><p><b>00:17:25.533 - 00:17:28.000</b><br>just go for these really high percentage<br></p><p><b>00:17:28.700 - 00:17:31.066</b><br>trades I think I even did that in my introduction video<br></p><p><b>00:17:31.333 - 00:17:34.100</b><br>where you can find these stocks that are thinly traded<br></p><p><b>00:17:34.666 - 00:17:37.733</b><br>where you can only take like a 200 dollar a 300 dollar<br></p><p><b>00:17:37.866 - 00:17:39.800</b><br>sometimes a 500 dollar trade<br></p><p><b>00:17:40.466 - 00:17:42.966</b><br>you can't take a big trade on it because there's no<br></p><p><b>00:17:43.566 - 00:17:46.533</b><br>participation there nobody's selling that much<br></p><p><b>00:17:46.700 - 00:17:47.800</b><br>you won't be able to sell it<br></p><p><b>00:17:47.800 - 00:17:50.000</b><br>once you buy too much of it if you do<br></p><p><b>00:17:50.733 - 00:17:53.000</b><br>so but the percentages are so high<br></p><p><b>00:17:53.000 - 00:17:56.366</b><br>like you can make 30 percent or 50 percent or 100%<br></p><p><b>00:17:56.600 - 00:17:58.066</b><br>on some of those trades<br></p><p><b>00:17:58.600 - 00:18:02.366</b><br>so even if you only put in $200 low you can make $200<br></p><p><b>00:18:03.366 - 00:18:05.600</b><br>but here's the downside to that right<br></p><p><b>00:18:05.900 - 00:18:07.133</b><br>the thing can fall<br></p><p><b>00:18:08.166 - 00:18:11.966</b><br>so just as much as you well maybe not as much but<br></p><p><b>00:18:12.400 - 00:18:15.533</b><br>just how you have this huge profit potential<br></p><p><b>00:18:15.566 - 00:18:17.000</b><br>you have a huge<br></p><p><b>00:18:17.333 - 00:18:18.500</b><br>chance for failure<br></p><p><b>00:18:19.866 - 00:18:22.666</b><br>but if you read the chart effectively<br></p><p><b>00:18:23.000 - 00:18:26.200</b><br>and somebody just sent me a chart yesterday<br></p><p><b>00:18:26.366 - 00:18:27.533</b><br>that was<br></p><p><b>00:18:27.666 - 00:18:31.366</b><br>he just he nailed it he understood what I was saying<br></p><p><b>00:18:31.400 - 00:18:33.466</b><br>and so I thought I'd bring that up today<br></p><p><b>00:18:34.600 - 00:18:36.700</b><br>but if he read the chart effectively<br></p><p><b>00:18:37.466 - 00:18:39.066</b><br>your your chances of<br></p><p><b>00:18:39.066 - 00:18:40.200</b><br>success are so high<br></p><p><b>00:18:40.200 - 00:18:41.766</b><br>and your chances of failure are so low<br></p><p><b>00:18:41.766 - 00:18:43.366</b><br>so let's just take a look at that chart that<br></p><p><b>00:18:43.366 - 00:18:45.900</b><br>guy sent me I'm gonna pause a video for a second<br></p><p><b>00:18:46.266 - 00:18:47.666</b><br>and get another drink my<br></p><p><b>00:18:47.866 - 00:18:49.200</b><br>migraine is just killing me<br></p><p><b>00:18:49.200 - 00:18:51.066</b><br>I should take drugs soon or something maybe<br></p><p><b>00:18:51.333 - 00:18:52.700</b><br>try to avoid taking drugs<br></p><p><b>00:18:52.900 - 00:18:55.566</b><br>for as much as I can even just addville<br></p><p><b>00:18:55.966 - 00:18:57.300</b><br>because I'm you know<br></p><p><b>00:18:58.066 - 00:18:59.200</b><br>I'm a health nut right<br></p><p><b>00:18:59.200 - 00:19:01.333</b><br>so I'm drinking my green juice and<br></p><p><b>00:19:02.700 - 00:19:03.966</b><br>anyway I'll be right back<br></p><p><b>00:19:04.600 - 00:19:09.966</b><br>okay so here's the coin that he was talking about PDC<br></p><p><b>00:19:11.133 - 00:19:14.166</b><br>and if you look at the coin you'll see that it's been<br></p><p><b>00:19:14.666 - 00:19:16.966</b><br>hitting around 18 50 18<br></p><p><b>00:19:17.333 - 00:19:20.800</b><br>and bouncing up to like 24 somewhere around 24<br></p><p><b>00:19:21.566 - 00:19:22.700</b><br>that's what it looks like<br></p><p><b>00:19:23.100 - 00:19:25.466</b><br>over this past five day period<br></p><p><b>00:19:25.866 - 00:19:28.933</b><br>but what he pointed out in his post is that<br></p><p><b>00:19:29.066 -

00:22:57.133</b><br>the only thing you're doing in this scenario is<br></p><p><b>00:22:59.900 - 00:23:01.333</b><br>looking for those high spikes<br></p><p><b>00:23:01.333 - 00:23:03.766</b><br>so you're buying in at all the lows<br></p><p><b>00:23:03.766 - 00:23:05.333</b><br>every time you get a little bit low<br></p><p><b>00:23:05.333 - 00:23:06.933</b><br>you're buying and buying and buying<br></p><p><b>00:23:06.933 - 00:23:08.100</b><br>and you're selling high<br></p><p><b>00:23:08.700 - 00:23:09.500</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:23:09.733 - 00:23:12.166</b><br>you know you can even sell a little bit over here<br></p><p><b>00:23:12.333 - 00:23:15.700</b><br>if you want to go in and layer your cells in<br></p><p><b>00:23:15.700 - 00:23:18.200</b><br>so you put a cell in a cell and a cell and a cell<br></p><p><b>00:23:18.200 - 00:23:20.600</b><br>and then maybe a big chunk your big chunk<br></p><p><b>00:23:20.600 - 00:23:21.666</b><br>on a high cell<br></p><p><b>00:23:23.700 - 00:23:26.700</b><br>but anyway the point is that you're reading the chart<br></p><p><b>00:23:26.900 - 00:23:29.600</b><br>and you're doing what the chart tells you to do<br></p><p><b>00:23:29.766 - 00:23:32.800</b><br>that's the same thing I'm doing in Ethereum right<br></p><p><b>00:23:32.966 - 00:23:34.600</b><br>it's a different strategy<br></p><p><b>00:23:34.733 - 00:23:37.933</b><br>but it's a professional way of looking at it<br></p><p><b>00:23:38.133 - 00:23:40.666</b><br>you're reading the chart and you're saying okay<br></p><p><b>00:23:41.200 - 00:23:43.666</b><br>so what's my wrist versus reward<br></p><p><b>00:23:43.766 - 00:23:45.566</b><br>my wrist is a lot<br></p><p><b>00:23:46.366 - 00:23:48.600</b><br>but it's very very small<br></p><p><b>00:23:48.600 - 00:23:51.766</b><br>my chance of failure is so tiny<br></p><p><b>00:23:51.800 - 00:23:53.000</b><br>because look at this thing<br></p><p><b>00:23:53.000 - 00:23:55.300</b><br>just keeps on doing the same thing<br></p><p><b>00:23:55.300 - 00:23:56.800</b><br>day in and day out<br></p><p><b>00:23:57.100 - 00:24:00.200</b><br>so my wrist is super small as far as that goes<br></p><p><b>00:24:00.933 - 00:24:03.533</b><br>my probability of loss is very very small<br></p><p><b>00:24:04.066 -

00:24:13.300</b><br>you're thinking of it<br></p><p><b>00:24:13.400 - 00:24:15.466</b><br>like a professional not not emotionally<br></p><p><b>00:24:15.466 - 00:24:16.766</b><br>you're thinking of it like a professional<br></p><p><b>00:24:16.766 -

00:24:22.733</b><br>according to the chart<br></p><p><b>00:24:22.733 - 00:24:24.766</b><br>now you can see I just bought some right here<br></p><p><b>00:24:25.200 - 00:24:26.400</b><br>because the guy allured me to it<br></p><p><b>00:24:26.400 -
