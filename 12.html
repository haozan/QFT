00:00:05.866</b><br>every day I'm trying to make a little video at noon<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.866 - 00:00:07.366</b><br>I take 10 minutes on my training day<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.400 - 00:00:08.866</b><br>it's Friday it's so slow<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.866 - 00:00:10.533</b><br>there's really not very much happening<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.533 - 00:00:12.700</b><br>you can see the etherium is dipping a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.200 - 00:00:14.766</b><br>what I wanted to talk to you guys about today<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.900 - 00:00:16.200</b><br>is a market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.933 - 00:00:18.666</b><br>I just sent off an email to<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.500 - 00:00:21.333</b><br>quangi I'm supposed to say quangi<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.466 - 00:00:22.466</b><br>I call it kanegi<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.700 - 00:00:23.566</b><br>it's just like<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.300 - 00:00:25.133</b><br>hit BTC<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.133 - 00:00:26.133</b><br>I call hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.600 - 00:00:27.800</b><br>I make up my own names for things<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.800 - 00:00:30.133</b><br>it's like support I call basis<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.500 - 00:00:31.700</b><br>because I<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.700 - 00:00:32.066</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.066 - 00:00:33.733</b><br>you can call a lot of different things support<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.733 - 00:00:36.300</b><br>and everybody kind of define support differently<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.933 - 00:00:38.966</b><br>so by making up our own word for it<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.133 - 00:00:40.700</b><br>in my case basis<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.166 - 00:00:42.966</b><br>then people know exactly what we're looking for<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.966 - 00:00:44.800</b><br>we're not looking for support really<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.166 - 00:00:46.900</b><br>what we're looking for is a base<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.900 - 00:00:50.666</b><br>and I define a base by the bounce that comes off of it<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.666 - 00:00:53.333</b><br>so I've said that a million times but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.100 - 00:00:56.266</b><br>I think that<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.400 - 00:00:59.533</b><br>a market scanner would be a game changer for us<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.300 - 00:01:03.533</b><br>so right now I don't make very many trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.400 - 00:01:06.366</b><br>I'm trading on the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.400 - 00:01:09.300</b><br>and I make trades all day long on the stock market and<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.300 - 00:01:10.500</b><br>that cost me commissions<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.500 - 00:01:12.533</b><br>you know like it's $5 in $5 out<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.533 - 00:01:15.600</b><br>so just to make one trade cost me $10<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.766 - 00:01:19.333</b><br>so you can imagine how much commissions<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.333 - 00:01:22.000</b><br>I mean I spend over $10,000<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.166 - 00:01:24.166</b><br>a year on commissions<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.933 - 00:01:27.366</b><br>so that's one of the huge advantages of<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.666 - 00:01:30.700</b><br>the crypto market is that we have such minuscule<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.466 - 00:01:32.366</b><br>commissions that<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.600 - 00:01:34.900</b><br>you don't even consider them<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.900 - 00:01:35.733</b><br>it's not even<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.800 - 00:01:37.733</b><br>so it would save me so much might just in commissions<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.733 - 00:01:39.066</b><br>but I'd like to move over<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.266 - 00:01:40.566</b><br>like I'd like to come over<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.700 - 00:01:44.166</b><br>and just trade cryptocurrencies and not trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.766 - 00:01:46.166</b><br>on the stock market anymore<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.200 - 00:01:48.533</b><br>but it can't do that because the tools aren't there yet<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.533 - 00:01:51.100</b><br>now Kenigi has awesome tools right<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.100 - 00:01:52.700</b><br>like like it's just great<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.700 - 00:01:55.200</b><br>you can just draw all over these charts<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.266 - 00:01:57.066</b><br>and and<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.266 - 00:01:58.500</b><br>you know all of your<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.500 - 00:02:01.566</b><br>all of your trades are planted on the screen for you<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.000 - 00:02:02.800</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.533 - 00:02:04.533</b><br>I just found out<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.800 - 00:02:05.133</b><br>a<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.133 - 00:02:08.666</b><br>few days ago somebody commented in the steam it blog<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.733 - 00:02:10.866</b><br>that if you hold down the shift button<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.166 - 00:02:12.100</b><br>and you press<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.100 - 00:02:14.000</b><br>let's say you pressed at the bottom of here<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.500 - 00:02:15.300</b><br>oh sorry<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.300 - 00:02:18.066</b><br>you have to be on you have to be on your pointer<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.466 - 00:02:20.200</b><br>but if you hold down the shift button on your<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.200 - 00:02:21.700</b><br>keyboard and you press here<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.966 - 00:02:24.733</b><br>and then you scroll up it tells you your percentage<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.733 - 00:02:27.333</b><br>so from there to there was<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.266 - 00:02:30.300</b><br>49 percent 50 percent<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.666 - 00:02:31.166</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.166 - 00:02:32.000</b><br>if you're having<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.000 - 00:02:32.866</b><br>trouble figuring out your<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.866 - 00:02:34.500</b><br>percentages I just do it in my head<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.800 - 00:02:35.733</b><br>but if you're having<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.733 - 00:02:37.766</b><br>trouble figuring out your percentages you can just<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.900 - 00:02:39.200</b><br>do that little trick<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.200 - 00:02:40.700</b><br>I don't know how to get out of it now<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.333 - 00:02:44.766</b><br>if I have to hit shift again I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.966 - 00:02:46.466</b><br>okay there you have to<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.100 - 00:02:48.066</b><br>right click<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.166 - 00:02:49.400</b><br>to get out of it but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.200 - 00:02:52.500</b><br>yeah you can just use that little trick to<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.933 - 00:02:55.866</b><br>figure it out like if you're trying to figure out okay<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.600 - 00:03:00.966</b><br>the thing is at 172 and it fell from 2 30<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.966 - 00:03:02.466</b><br>what's the percentage there<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.100 - 00:03:06.166</b><br>I can see how that can be tricky but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.200 - 00:03:08.800</b><br>okay so getting back on topic<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.300 - 00:03:13.133</b><br>what we need is a market scanner and<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.266 - 00:03:14.200</b><br>I know Kenigi has<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.200 - 00:03:15.066</b><br>lots of great<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.066 - 00:03:17.066</b><br>tools and hopefully what you guys<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.066 - 00:03:19.133</b><br>have been doing with these tools is you're going<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.333 - 00:03:20.200</b><br>and saying okay<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.200 - 00:03:23.466</b><br>here's my base and here's my base and here's my base<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.466 - 00:03:25.900</b><br>and so anything under 170 I want by<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.200 - 00:03:28.100</b><br>so you switch over to<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.766 - 00:03:31.933</b><br>pointer you switch over to alerts<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.933 - 00:03:33.266</b><br>and you say okay<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.200 - 00:03:35.333</b><br>I'm going to take this alert<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.333 - 00:03:37.333</b><br>and I'm going to drop it down under 170<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.333 - 00:03:40.066</b><br>and set my alert and then if<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.366 - 00:03:41.133</b><br>this thing goes under<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.133 - 00:03:42.966</b><br>170 I'm in a byte or you just set up<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.966 - 00:03:45.333</b><br>you just have bias you just go and stick<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.333 - 00:03:47.733</b><br>maybe a nibble underneath that 160<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.966 - 00:03:49.733</b><br>and you're rated nibble in case<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.166 - 00:03:52.533</b><br>it drops so basically<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.666 - 00:03:53.533</b><br>you go through<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.533 - 00:03:55.300</b><br>each chart in your favorites<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.300 - 00:03:57.133</b><br>you went and assigned all these favorites<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.133 - 00:03:58.400</b><br>these are my favorites<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.733 - 00:03:59.400</b><br>and you go through<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.400 - 00:04:00.366</b><br>all of these charts<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.366 - 00:04:03.100</b><br>and you set up alerts just underneath all the bases<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.100 - 00:04:04.000</b><br>and then you just<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.000 - 00:04:06.400</b><br>sit back and wait for it to go ding ding ding ding<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.000 - 00:04:09.766</b><br>but the market is so much bigger than<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.000 - 00:04:11.700</b><br>what you have in your favorites<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.133 - 00:04:14.766</b><br>my favorites are based on volume<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.966 - 00:04:17.466</b><br>based on whether their charts look perfect<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.466 - 00:04:20.066</b><br>and based on whether I like the project that<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.066 - 00:04:22.533</b><br>that company is working on that the coin represents<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.200 - 00:04:25.366</b><br>so that's how I pick my favorites<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.466 - 00:04:27.766</b><br>but the market is like way way bigger<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.766 - 00:04:29.200</b><br>there's so many coins up there<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.266 - 00:04:31.000</b><br>so if we had a market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.333 - 00:04:33.600</b><br>the market scanner would do the work for us<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.600 - 00:04:35.133</b><br>and here let me show you what<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.166 - 00:04:38.666</b><br>my market scanner looks like in my stock market<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.800 - 00:04:40.566</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.566 - 00:04:42.900</b><br>in the stock market here I'll just bring one down<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.533 - 00:04:46.366</b><br>this would be a typical scanner for me right<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.500 - 00:04:48.500</b><br>and so if you go to scanner info<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.966 - 00:04:52.600</b><br>it'll say look I want this thing to be the last<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.733 - 00:04:55.000</b><br>the price I want it to be over<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.000 - 00:04:58.533</b><br>you know a 20th of a penny<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.600 - 00:05:02.100</b><br>so like anything I don't want to go too low under a pen<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.100 - 00:05:03.600</b><br>so anything over that<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.500 - 00:05:05.900</b><br>and I want the last<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.366 - 00:05:07.166</b><br>to be<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.300 - 00:05:10.666</b><br>equal or less than $5<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.666 - 00:05:13.933</b><br>so I'm trading between under a penny up to $5<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.400 - 00:05:17.933</b><br>and I want there to be a five minute percent change<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.666 - 00:05:19.600</b><br>greater than<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.966 - 00:05:23.400</b><br>in this case it says less than minus 10 so it's<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.800 - 00:05:26.966</b><br>more of a drop than 10%<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.966 - 00:05:27.933</b><br>I want the<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.266 - 00:05:31.266</b><br>penny stock in this case anything under $5<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.266 - 00:05:32.266</b><br>to have dropped<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.266 - 00:05:35.066</b><br>more than 10% within the last five minutes<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.533 - 00:05:36.933</b><br>and then again alert right<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.933 - 00:05:37.933</b><br>and then boop this<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.933 - 00:05:38.800</b><br>shows up saying<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.800 - 00:05:40.100</b><br>this thing dropped more than<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.100 - 00:05:41.700</b><br>10 percent in the last five minutes<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.700 - 00:05:43.600</b><br>and it meets your other criteria<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.933 - 00:05:46.900</b><br>so that's what a market scanner does<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.566 - 00:05:49.133</b><br>let me just go back to our<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.166 - 00:05:50.966</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.200 - 00:05:52.566</b><br>with a market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.966 - 00:05:56.200</b><br>all of these alerts would be almost unnecessary<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.400 - 00:05:58.866</b><br>because you could set up a scanner that says<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.566 - 00:06:01.900</b><br>I want this amount of volume per day<br></p><p><b>00:06:01.900 - 00:06:04.133</b><br>I want a coin that trades more than<br></p><p><b>00:06:04.133 -

00:12:13.066</b><br>you draw a base in there<br></p><p><b>00:12:13.066 - 00:12:15.500</b><br>because you had a fairly decent balance to hear<br></p><p><b>00:12:16.333 - 00:12:17.700</b><br>anyway I got in there<br></p><p><b>00:12:17.733 - 00:12:19.700</b><br>and I only sold part position on this<br></p><p><b>00:12:19.700 - 00:12:21.266</b><br>so I don't get a little red arrow<br></p><p><b>00:12:21.266 - 00:12:22.333</b><br>which would be awesome<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.333 - 00:12:23.666</b><br>but I probably sold some there<br></p><p><b>00:12:25.366 - 00:12:27.333</b><br>and then of course your base is now here<br></p><p><b>00:12:27.500 - 00:12:29.966</b><br>and here's your safety circle<br></p><p><b>00:12:30.400 -
