00:00:04.400</b><br>so I have to go to the stock Mark in a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:00:04.400 - 00:00:05.966</b><br>I've been up most of the night<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.200 - 00:00:09.733</b><br>ugh dealing with this bitcoin cache situation<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.866 - 00:00:11.266</b><br>and I just want to do a quick update<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.266 - 00:00:13.333</b><br>for you guys on what's going on with that<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.366 - 00:00:16.400</b><br>so I found a way to split my cold wallets<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.400 - 00:00:18.200</b><br>and send myself to Bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.200 - 00:00:19.666</b><br>which I sent to Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.733 - 00:00:23.066</b><br>which takes 20 confirmations and block time on<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.733 - 00:00:25.733</b><br>Bitcoin cache is ridiculous<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.733 - 00:00:28.133</b><br>like I think over the entire night<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.766 - 00:00:30.166</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.166 - 00:00:31.766</b><br>maybe I got through five blocks<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.766 - 00:00:34.300</b><br>so the confirmations are so slow<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.466 - 00:00:35.666</b><br>so you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.366 - 00:00:37.666</b><br>this is what I used<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.933 - 00:00:40.500</b><br>coin nomi wallet<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.500 - 00:00:43.500</b><br>so this works pretty good actually<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.533 - 00:00:47.733</b><br>it's very not very technical so it's nice and easy<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.733 - 00:00:49.166</b><br>and there's a website<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.700 - 00:00:50.566</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.800 - 00:00:53.400</b><br>I'll post a link to this website<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.400 - 00:00:55.666</b><br>which gives you clear directions on<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.866 - 00:00:57.400</b><br>how to go ahead and<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.566 - 00:01:00.466</b><br>take your wallets and<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.600 - 00:01:04.066</b><br>split them using that little app<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.466 - 00:01:09.166</b><br>and the most important part is this thing the mh44 h<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.733 - 00:01:13.266</b><br>0h 0h this thing in your advanced settings<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.300 - 00:01:14.666</b><br>so read through this<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.700 - 00:01:16.766</b><br>really clearly if you're going to do it that way<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.100 - 00:01:18.733</b><br>and you can divide<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.733 - 00:01:20.000</b><br>you can split your coins<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.000 - 00:01:22.333</b><br>and then you can send them to Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.466 - 00:01:24.733</b><br>but of course everybody is<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.066 - 00:01:26.866</b><br>sending their coins to Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.933 - 00:01:27.966</b><br>and the<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.966 - 00:01:30.566</b><br>price is just dropping and dropping and dropping and<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.566 - 00:01:32.133</b><br>dropping and that's because<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.900 - 00:01:34.600</b><br>as soon as it gets to Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.600 - 00:01:37.566</b><br>you feel the need to sell it because<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.966 - 00:01:39.300</b><br>you know like after you wait your<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.300 - 00:01:40.333</b><br>20 confirmations<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.333 - 00:01:43.466</b><br>which takes almost 24 hours a full day<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.966 - 00:01:45.700</b><br>and finally you get your<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.700 - 00:01:47.733</b><br>your coins and then when you do<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.500 - 00:01:50.366</b><br>the price has just been steadily dropping<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.366 - 00:01:51.366</b><br>so you're like well<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.366 - 00:01:54.400</b><br>if I don't sell it right now at 400 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.700 - 00:01:56.366</b><br>then in<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.666 - 00:02:00.366</b><br>you know four hours from now it's going to be 271<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.366 - 00:02:01.566</b><br>which is what it is now<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.866 - 00:02:05.166</b><br>so last night at $440 I was looking at it thinking<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.166 - 00:02:08.133</b><br>oh man if I could just get some confirmations<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.366 - 00:02:12.800</b><br>you know I could get out at $440 and now we're at 271<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.100 - 00:02:15.533</b><br>and I still got coins coming so<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.700 - 00:02:17.766</b><br>and so does everybody else that's what's happening<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.766 - 00:02:21.100</b><br>everybody's trying to send their coins to exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.533 - 00:02:23.600</b><br>to just try to get out of this thing<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.333 - 00:02:25.133</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.733 - 00:02:28.100</b><br>the block time takes so long<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.100 - 00:02:31.700</b><br>that it's not even remotely<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.700 - 00:02:34.900</b><br>comparing to what bitcoin does 10 minute block<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.266 - 00:02:36.466</b><br>type for Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.166 - 00:02:40.166</b><br>and like I don't know an hour and a half two hours<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.166 - 00:02:41.900</b><br>I don't know what it is now for<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.766 - 00:02:43.866</b><br>bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.866 - 00:02:49.400</b><br>now if you're with Coin Base you must be pissed<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.400 - 00:02:52.333</b><br>oh my goodness I can only imagine if I had<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.266 - 00:02:55.100</b><br>coins stored at Coin Base<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.100 - 00:02:57.366</b><br>because Coin Base just put out an update<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.400 - 00:02:59.533</b><br>saying here's their update<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.866 - 00:03:03.333</b><br>and they're saying that don't worry everybody<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.466 - 00:03:06.200</b><br>both your bitcoin and your bitcoin cash remain<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.200 - 00:03:08.366</b><br>safely stored on coin base<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.166 - 00:03:11.366</b><br>and then over the last several days we've<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.566 - 00:03:13.566</b><br>examined all the relevant issues<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.566 - 00:03:14.666</b><br>and decided to work on<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.666 - 00:03:16.700</b><br>adding support for Bitcoin Cash<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.700 - 00:03:18.466</b><br>so all of the like Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.800 - 00:03:19.866</b><br>coin base is like<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.866 - 00:03:22.366</b><br>one of the biggest places that everybody has<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.000 - 00:03:25.533</b><br>bitcoins at you know that's where most new people<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.666 - 00:03:26.600</b><br>first go<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.766 - 00:03:28.066</b><br>to get bitcoins<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.133 - 00:03:30.766</b><br>so there's so many accounts over there<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.966 - 00:03:32.500</b><br>people are so upset<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.766 - 00:03:36.933</b><br>and now they're finally saying that we will actually<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.200 - 00:03:38.400</b><br>start to support<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.700 - 00:03:39.866</b><br>Bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.933 - 00:03:42.366</b><br>just to for you to be able to withdraw<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.366 - 00:03:43.700</b><br>your Bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.733 - 00:03:45.866</b><br>not for trading or anything else<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.866 - 00:03:47.566</b><br>they're just saying to be able to withdraw it<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.566 - 00:03:48.900</b><br>but look at this<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.166 - 00:03:52.800</b><br>were planning to have support for Bitcoin Cash<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.933 - 00:03:56.566</b><br>by January 1st 2,018<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.700 -

00:05:18.566</b><br>you know that I sold some<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.566 - 00:05:21.533</b><br>in the three hundreds and three 50s and four fifties<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.700 - 00:05:23.366</b><br>so now I'm sitting on that cache<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.766 - 00:05:24.900</b><br>if this thing decides<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.000 - 00:05:28.500</b><br>to just give us a good drop under 100 you know maybe<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.733 - 00:05:31.366</b><br>50 dollars 60 dollars or something I might load up<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.066 - 00:05:33.466</b><br>and you know make some day<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.466 - 00:05:35.666</b><br>trades off of it and then maybe hold some<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.066 - 00:05:36.500</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.500 -
