00:00:05.566</b><br>with me I haven't been very active on<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.366 - 00:00:08.500</b><br>Slack or discord or<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.000 - 00:00:09.966</b><br>even steam it<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.066 - 00:00:11.966</b><br>lately my steam it account<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.200 - 00:00:14.766</b><br>looks terrible what's my wallet look like now<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.700 - 00:00:16.566</b><br>oh my<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.700 - 00:00:20.733</b><br>so my account is worth $1,250 in steam it<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.966 - 00:00:24.100</b><br>I remember when my account was over 10 grand and now<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.100 - 00:00:26.166</b><br>it's only worth $1,000 so<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.933 - 00:00:27.766</b><br>that's<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.400 - 00:00:29.766</b><br>10 times the value<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.766 - 00:00:30.800</b><br>that's insane<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.000 - 00:00:32.733</b><br>so that means steam it somewhere around<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.800 - 00:00:33.600</b><br></p><p><b>00:00:34.900 - 00:00:38.266</b><br>73 cents steam it is at 73 cents<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.266 - 00:00:40.066</b><br>ouch<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.666 - 00:00:43.266</b><br>and here's the general room of the Slack<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.533 - 00:00:45.066</b><br>and you can see that it's not<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.066 - 00:00:46.666</b><br>quite as active as it used to be<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.666 - 00:00:49.800</b><br>the 9th the 11th the 12th<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.100 - 00:00:50.966</b><br>yesterday<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.100 - 00:00:54.466</b><br>and that's indicative of the market as a whole<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.566 - 00:00:56.000</b><br>if we go back to<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.566 - 00:01:00.066</b><br>coin market cap and we go over the top over here<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.066 - 00:01:02.000</b><br>to 24 hour volume<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.000 - 00:01:03.566</b><br>that should bring us a chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.500 - 00:01:06.266</b><br>and then we can take a look at<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.566 - 00:01:08.133</b><br>market capitalization<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.600 - 00:01:11.066</b><br>let's go with excluding Bitcoin because<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.100 - 00:01:14.066</b><br>that'll show us the alt a little clearer<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.766 - 00:01:16.200</b><br>and we can see that<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.133 - 00:01:19.400</b><br>looks like right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.133 - 00:01:22.866</b><br>we got about 7 billion USD<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.400 - 00:01:24.500</b><br>traded in a day<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.933 - 00:01:28.100</b><br>whereas it used to be up at like even just in may<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.566 - 00:01:30.466</b><br>over here it was at 17 billion<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.600 - 00:01:32.600</b><br>so I wish that this chart would show us<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.600 - 00:01:34.933</b><br>how many trades are actually actively<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.866 - 00:01:36.666</b><br>being<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.100 - 00:01:37.900</b><br>made<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.066 - 00:01:40.300</b><br>instead of showing us like overall volume<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.300 - 00:01:41.333</b><br>if they showed us<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.966 - 00:01:42.766</b><br>how many trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.766 - 00:01:43.166</b><br>were being made<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.166 - 00:01:43.700</b><br>then we know at<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.700 - 00:01:45.733</b><br>least how much participation there was in the market<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.733 - 00:01:46.533</b><br>right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.100 - 00:01:49.966</b><br>anyway as you can see from this chart of Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.100 - 00:01:52.600</b><br>you know the volume here<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.466 - 00:01:55.200</b><br>is quite a bit lower<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.300 - 00:01:56.100</b><br>than<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.733 - 00:01:57.600</b><br>what it used to be<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.733 - 00:02:01.066</b><br>so the participation is not there and that's<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.266 - 00:02:03.400</b><br>that's the same thing with the stock market right now<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.400 - 00:02:04.533</b><br>at summertime<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.800 - 00:02:07.133</b><br>and Bitcoin's price has gone down<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.366 - 00:02:10.466</b><br>we're in kind of like a bare market looking situation<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.766 - 00:02:14.300</b><br>and you know bitcoin keeps on bouncing off the 6000<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.466 - 00:02:18.400</b><br>I've heard some talk of the 6000 as being where<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.166 - 00:02:20.100</b><br>miners<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.133 - 00:02:23.166</b><br>you know are not making a profit anymore<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.333 - 00:02:24.900</b><br>and so because<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.900 - 00:02:25.500</b><br>miners are<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.500 - 00:02:29.000</b><br>not making a profit at 5,000 or 4,000 or 3,000<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.666 - 00:02:32.566</b><br>somehow that supports the price of 6000<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.933 - 00:02:34.700</b><br>I'm not sure I haven't really given that much<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.700 - 00:02:35.933</b><br>thought to try to figure out<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.000 - 00:02:37.266</b><br>how that makes sense<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.266 - 00:02:38.800</b><br>so if any of you think that<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.800 - 00:02:41.266</b><br>the miners are actually supporting the price of 6000<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.266 - 00:02:42.300</b><br>that's why it won't go lower<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.300 - 00:02:43.900</b><br>if you have some information on that<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.900 - 00:02:45.400</b><br>and you'd like to share your thoughts<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.400 - 00:02:46.466</b><br>I'd like to hear it<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.133 - 00:02:48.966</b><br>because I don't really understand how that<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.966 - 00:02:50.733</b><br>why that would matter<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.000 - 00:02:54.200</b><br>so from a trader's perspective<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.300 - 00:02:57.500</b><br>this chart does look really strange to me<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.133 - 00:02:59.766</b><br>this 6000 support<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.000 - 00:03:02.366</b><br>like before this whole run started<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.066 - 00:03:05.200</b><br>we touched 6000 right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.166 - 00:03:08.666</b><br>and then we clearly touched it here<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.066 - 00:03:10.900</b><br>we almost touched it here<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.366 - 00:03:12.866</b><br>and we touched it here<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.866 - 00:03:13.700</b><br>and we touched it<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.700 - 00:03:15.933</b><br>here and now we just touched it again there<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.266 - 00:03:21.466</b><br>so you know for almost a year from from last October<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.766 - 00:03:22.766</b><br>all the way until<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.966 - 00:03:25.733</b><br>the middle of September so almost a full year<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.466 - 00:03:27.800</b><br>6,000<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.066 - 00:03:29.533</b><br>has been a solid<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.533 - 00:03:30.800</b><br>spot of support<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.100 - 00:03:33.200</b><br>and that's very strange<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.166 - 00:03:37.333</b><br>can you imagine all of the stops that are sitting<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.866 - 00:03:40.766</b><br>under 6000 like between 6000 and 5000<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.766 - 00:03:42.866</b><br>can you imagine the stops that are sitting there<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.733 - 00:03:47.100</b><br>and how the market could really take a big dive<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.266 - 00:03:49.500</b><br>if it ever broke through this area<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.500 - 00:03:52.066</b><br>through 5 to 6 000 area right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.600 - 00:03:53.933</b><br>my goodness<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.933 - 00:03:55.900</b><br>because it's been building for a year<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.733 - 00:03:58.066</b><br>anyway that's something to think about<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.066 - 00:03:59.733</b><br>let's just erase those lines<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.000 - 00:04:00.800</b><br>so again<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.600 - 00:04:04.000</b><br>I've been trading very much<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.400 - 00:04:05.266</b><br>don't get me wrong<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.266 - 00:04:08.200</b><br>I've been trading like plenty on the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.066 - 00:04:11.566</b><br>but just with the low volume<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.666 - 00:04:13.133</b><br>if I'm doing AB<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.133 - 00:04:16.300</b><br>trades and there's really very little volume there<br></p><p><b>00:04:16.300 - 00:04:18.366</b><br>and I've been getting a lot of complaints too from<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.733 - 00:04:20.100</b><br>members in our community<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.100 - 00:04:23.533</b><br>that you know they'll go days without<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.800 - 00:04:26.933</b><br>catching a good trade on on coins<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.966 - 00:04:29.766</b><br>that they used to AB trade all the time<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.800 - 00:04:31.666</b><br>so let's look at an example real quick<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.700 - 00:04:33.133</b><br>so here's a chart of dice<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.133 - 00:04:34.566</b><br>something that I like to trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.566 - 00:04:36.266</b><br>while I used to like to trade all the time<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.733 - 00:04:39.166</b><br>and you can see like 67 months ago<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.366 - 00:04:40.766</b><br>this thing was whippy<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.766 - 00:04:41.533</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.533 - 00:04:44.266</b><br>every day just bouncing back and forth from like<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.266 - 00:04:47.200</b><br>what what is it like 1916 17 18<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.200 - 00:04:48.000</b><br></p><p><b>00:04:48.266 - 00:04:50.933</b><br>all the way up to in the 30s 31 32<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.200 - 00:04:55.100</b><br>so from 16 to 30 is these are huge whippy<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.100 - 00:04:55.900</b><br>things<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.100 - 00:04:57.166</b><br>constantly right<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.666 - 00:04:58.600</b><br>and then you get this<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.600 - 00:05:01.300</b><br>grind down and you still get your whips up<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.766 - 00:05:03.300</b><br>but look at over here<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.600 - 00:05:06.366</b><br>like still even over here was still fairly whippy<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.600 - 00:05:07.866</b><br>but you can see how<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.866 - 00:05:10.466</b><br>the volume is slowly dying off until<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.666 - 00:05:13.366</b><br>you get like this two month period over here<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.600 - 00:05:15.900</b><br>with nothing just like<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.300 - 00:05:20.466</b><br>barely any movement barely any volume just<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.800 - 00:05:21.766</b><br>you know nothing<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.800 - 00:05:23.266</b><br>and then when it dropped off<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.266 - 00:05:24.900</b><br>I wasn't even looking at it anymore<br></p><p><b>00:05:24.933 - 00:05:26.333</b><br>when it dropped off here<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.333 - 00:05:28.900</b><br>it dropped from like 16 down to like<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.166 - 00:05:31.133</b><br>11 cents or whatever 11<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.733 - 00:05:32.966</b><br>from 16 to 11<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.966 - 00:05:34.766</b><br>I didn't get<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.266 - 00:05:35.700</b><br>any of that<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.700 - 00:05:37.400</b><br>I know I got some the other day at 9<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.500 - 00:05:40.100</b><br>so like I did I did get this little dip<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.333 - 00:05:43.900</b><br>did I sell the 10s I can't remember<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.900 - 00:05:44.766</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.400 - 00:05:47.400</b><br>what I'm saying is that it's just dead<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.466 - 00:05:48.266</b><br>just dead<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.166 - 00:05:50.333</b><br>so contrast that<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.800 - 00:05:52.100</b><br>dice chart with<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.100 - 00:05:52.900</b><br>ether<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.900 - 00:05:55.566</b><br>you know and look at the volume<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.800 - 00:05:58.500</b><br>non stop volume like there's no change really<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.566 - 00:05:59.500</b><br>you can see my little<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.600 - 00:06:01.966</b><br>green arrow because I bought 185 the other day<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.900 - 00:06:04.533</b><br>but yeah you can see like<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.133 - 00:06:06.100</b><br>Ethereum just<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.166 - 00:06:07.066</b><br>there's no difference<br></p><p><b>00:06:07.066 - 00:06:09.533</b><br>and that the reason behind that is because<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.166 - 00:06:12.333</b><br>while everybody is giving up and not<br></p><p><b>00:06:12.333 - 00:06:14.733</b><br>looking at all of those little alt coins<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.766 - 00:06:16.300</b><br>when the market is dropping<br></p><p><b>00:06:16.866 - 00:06:19.366</b><br>everybody's dealing with the bigger coins right<br></p><p><b>00:06:19.366 - 00:06:21.700</b><br>so if you take a look at Bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:06:22.966 - 00:06:24.766</b><br>you can see that the volume is steady<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.900 - 00:06:26.100</b><br>and if you look at<br></p><p><b>00:06:27.333 - 00:06:30.800</b><br>EOS you can see that the volume is pretty steady<br></p><p><b>00:06:32.266 - 00:06:33.800</b><br>actually you can see some of my trades<br></p><p><b>00:06:36.766 - 00:06:37.866</b><br>so that's what I do too<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.866 - 00:06:39.700</b><br>when the market is going down when<br></p><p><b>00:06:39.866 - 00:06:41.366</b><br>bitcoin is not doing so hot<br></p><p><b>00:06:41.466 - 00:06:44.166</b><br>then I focus my attention on position trades<br></p><p><b>00:06:44.500 - 00:06:46.266</b><br>I don't take AB<br></p><p><b>00:06:46.266 - 00:06:47.000</b><br>trades very much<br></p><p><b>00:06:47.000 - 00:06:48.900</b><br>because there's just not very much participation<br></p><p><b>00:06:48.933 - 00:06:50.000</b><br>there's not much volume<br></p><p><b>00:06:50.000 - 00:06:51.800</b><br>there's not many trades in the chart<br></p><p><b>00:06:51.866 - 00:06:54.600</b><br>and so I focus my attention more on<br></p><p><b>00:06:55.366 - 00:06:58.200</b><br>only the bigger names only the bigger coins<br></p><p><b>00:06:58.200 - 00:07:01.566</b><br>and at least being able to continue to<br></p><p><b>00:07:01.733 - 00:07:04.466</b><br>make some free coins out of the bigger coins<br></p><p><b>00:07:04.800 - 00:07:08.000</b><br>so you know that I'm all about getting free coins<br></p><p><b>00:07:08.300 - 00:07:10.933</b><br>making free coins and there's different ways to do that<br></p><p><b>00:07:11.700 - 00:07:14.500</b><br>but right now while participation is really low<br></p><p><b>00:07:14.666 - 00:07:16.333</b><br>and you're not getting as many<br></p><p><b>00:07:16.333 - 00:07:18.333</b><br>account building trades as you used to<br></p><p><b>00:07:18.333 - 00:07:20.400</b><br>you have to really find those awesome charts<br></p><p><b>00:07:20.400 - 00:07:23.300</b><br>but they're few and far between because<br></p><p><b>00:07:24.600 - 00:07:25.766</b><br>if any<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.766 - 00:07:27.166</b><br>of the volume that's out there<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.166 - 00:07:29.000</b><br>is being put into the major coins<br></p><p><b>00:07:29.000 - 00:07:30.900</b><br>and there just isn't that much participation<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.900 - 00:07:32.133</b><br>on the smaller coins<br></p><p><b>00:07:32.366 - 00:07:34.500</b><br>so there's a trick that I've been using<br></p><p><b>00:07:34.500 - 00:07:36.333</b><br>that gets me some frequent<br></p><p><b>00:07:36.400 - 00:07:37.600</b><br>so basically it goes like this<br></p><p><b>00:07:37.600 - 00:07:39.866</b><br>I try to find exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:07:40.266 - 00:07:44.700</b><br>that aren't very well used and then<br></p><p><b>00:07:45.400 - 00:07:47.933</b><br>Cherry pick coins<br></p><p><b>00:07:48.100 -

00:07:58.266</b><br>coin market cap<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.466 - 00:08:00.266</b><br>and you go to rankings<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.600 - 00:08:02.666</b><br>and you go to top 100<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.766 - 00:08:03.900</b><br>exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:08:05.266 - 00:08:05.933</b><br>that lists your<br></p><p><b>00:08:05.933 - 00:08:07.900</b><br>exchanges right from the top from Vinance<br></p><p><b>00:08:07.900 - 00:08:09.366</b><br>which is doing volume<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.366 - 00:08:11.600</b><br>24 hour volume of $1 billion<br></p><p><b>00:08:12.900 - 00:08:14.700</b><br>and you take it all the way down<br></p><p><b>00:08:14.700 - 00:08:16.466</b><br>and you go all the way down to the bottom over here<br></p><p><b>00:08:16.466 - 00:08:17.566</b><br>and you'll start to get into<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.800 - 00:08:19.266</b><br>some really low<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.466 -

00:08:30.866</b><br>somewhere around there or or under<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.100 - 00:08:32.333</b><br>so go to the next<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.866 - 00:08:34.166</b><br>100 and<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.933 - 00:08:36.966</b><br>coin exchange look at that<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.000 - 00:08:38.966</b><br>I've been using that a lot actually<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.966 - 00:08:41.733</b><br>so I'll try to give you the ones that I've been liking<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.733 - 00:08:42.266</b><br>lately<br></p><p><b>00:08:42.266 - 00:08:43.400</b><br>coin exchange is great<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.133 - 00:08:45.866</b><br>they have some really good dips<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.866 - 00:08:47.400</b><br>that don't make a lot of sense<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.700 - 00:08:51.566</b><br>well anyway you can see that there is<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.566 - 00:08:53.733</b><br>there's a cost there's a lot<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.966 - 00:08:54.766</b><br>of<br></p><p><b>00:08:55.966 - 00:08:58.133</b><br>wants to choose from you know all like<br></p><p><b>00:08:58.133 - 00:08:59.600</b><br>well there's 100 right here<br></p><p><b>00:08:59.733 - 00:09:00.533</b><br>to pick from<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.666 - 00:09:03.566</b><br>and you can just go coin coin Nest Coin rail<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.366 - 00:09:05.533</b><br>you can just go and try<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.533 - 00:09:07.600</b><br>each of these now they're not going to work with<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.766 - 00:09:08.566</b><br>Coin AG<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.533 - 00:09:11.533</b><br>so you have to just<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.533 - 00:09:14.000</b><br>use each exchange by themselves but here let me<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.000 - 00:09:14.533</b><br>show you some<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.533 - 00:09:17.400</b><br>examples so unfortunately I can't put this on a<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.400 - 00:09:18.600</b><br>white screen I wish<br></p><p><b>00:09:18.966 - 00:09:20.300</b><br>I could make this white for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.300 - 00:09:21.666</b><br>so I hope you guys can see this<br></p><p><b>00:09:21.966 - 00:09:23.266</b><br>this is Cobin Hood<br></p><p><b>00:09:23.266 - 00:09:25.133</b><br>and I've been enjoying Cobin Hood for<br></p><p><b>00:09:25.133 - 00:09:27.400</b><br>maybe about 5 months now 6 months<br></p><p><b>00:09:28.600 - 00:09:30.666</b><br>so this is cob to ether<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.800 - 00:09:34.533</b><br>so that's their coin like their exchange coin so cob<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.800 - 00:09:36.200</b><br>and you can see that I<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.200 - 00:09:38.200</b><br>I guess you can't tell that I bought this dip<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.200 - 00:09:39.533</b><br>but you can see my orders<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.566 - 00:09:42.666</b><br>that I want to buy it again 10,000 10,000 10,000<br></p><p><b>00:09:42.700 - 00:09:45.366</b><br>but anyway I got this dip where the price was<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.466 - 00:09:46.800</b><br>you know at 9<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.200 - 00:09:47.800</b><br>you can see<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.800 - 00:09:50.166</b><br>over here in the corner where the price is right<br></p><p><b>00:09:50.166 - 00:09:51.366</b><br>over there so<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.533 - 00:09:52.666</b><br>the price was at 9<br></p><p><b>00:09:52.700 - 00:09:54.933</b><br>and it dropped all the way down to 3 8<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.866 - 00:09:56.666</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:09:56.700 - 00:09:58.933</b><br>and then within about I don't know 15<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.933 - 00:10:01.800</b><br>20 minutes it was all the way back up at 82<br></p><p><b>00:10:02.066 - 00:10:05.466</b><br>and then over the next day or two it went back up to 9<br></p><p><b>00:10:05.533 - 00:10:06.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:10:07.000 - 00:10:09.666</b><br>within a few seconds within a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.866 - 00:10:10.666</b><br>you<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.300 - 00:10:15.600</b><br>picked up all these coins on this massive drop and then<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.400 - 00:10:18.466</b><br>right away boom your back<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.066 - 00:10:21.466</b><br>you know having double your money or triple your money<br></p><p><b>00:10:21.466 - 00:10:23.066</b><br>within just a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.066 - 00:10:25.466</b><br>and so that so basically<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.466 - 00:10:28.133</b><br>at that point when it just jump right back up here<br></p><p><b>00:10:28.300 - 00:10:30.133</b><br>then half of it I sell<br></p><p><b>00:10:30.133 - 00:10:32.866</b><br>and get all my money back with some profit<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.266 - 00:10:35.366</b><br>and the other half I just keep as coin<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.266 - 00:10:37.466</b><br>and this keeps happening<br></p><p><b>00:10:37.466 - 00:10:38.966</b><br>I know it hasn't happened again<br></p><p><b>00:10:38.966 - 00:10:39.766</b><br>on this<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.966 - 00:10:41.666</b><br>even though I've had these orders sitting there now<br></p><p><b>00:10:41.666 - 00:10:43.100</b><br>for the past four months<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.700 - 00:10:45.566</b><br>but that's what I was talking about you're<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.566 - 00:10:47.600</b><br>able to pick these exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.866 - 00:10:48.566</b><br>where you<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.566 - 00:10:50.933</b><br>think that this kind of action is going to happen<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.533 - 00:10:52.333</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:10:53.100 - 00:10:56.100</b><br>pick up coins like dirt dirt dirt cheap<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.133 - 00:10:57.700</b><br>for a few seconds<br></p><p><b>00:10:57.700 - 00:10:59.500</b><br>and be able to sell them here<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.500 - 00:11:00.900</b><br>let me show you another example<br></p><p><b>00:11:01.066 - 00:11:02.066</b><br>here's another one<br></p><p><b>00:11:03.166 - 00:11:04.400</b><br>well it was just a double<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.400 - 00:11:06.066</b><br>you know just picking it up at<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.600 - 00:11:10.566</b><br>44 and then and then immediately it's up over 10<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.133 - 00:11:13.466</b><br>so that's just a quick double that's on act<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.800 - 00:11:17.500</b><br>here's another example this is P to ether<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.700 - 00:11:21.000</b><br>and you can see a drop all the way down to around 3 5<br></p><p><b>00:11:21.166 - 00:11:25.500</b><br>maybe even 3 and then from 3 all the way up to<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.466 - 00:11:27.266</b><br></p><p><b>00:11:27.766 - 00:11:31.400</b><br>22 23 so you can do the math on that<br></p><p><b>00:11:31.700 - 00:11:34.200</b><br>many many many times your money<br></p><p><b>00:11:34.366 - 00:11:36.300</b><br>not only did it give you this dip once<br></p><p><b>00:11:36.300 - 00:11:38.866</b><br>but then a few days later it gave you the dip again<br></p><p><b>00:11:39.000 - 00:11:40.300</b><br>and then about<br></p><p><b>00:11:40.366 - 00:11:42.666</b><br>I don't know three weeks later it gave you the dip<br></p><p><b>00:11:42.666 - 00:11:43.466</b><br>again<br></p><p><b>00:11:44.133 - 00:11:45.533</b><br>okay so here's ply<br></p><p><b>00:11:45.666 - 00:11:47.766</b><br>ply to ether and this is<br></p><p><b>00:11:48.200 - 00:11:50.166</b><br>you know a few months not even a few months ago<br></p><p><b>00:11:50.166 - 00:11:51.066</b><br>a few weeks ago<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.266 - 00:11:53.900</b><br>822 so like four weeks ago<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.733 - 00:11:57.333</b><br>we started off if you look over here at the right<br></p><p><b>00:11:57.366 - 00:11:59.800</b><br>you can see that we were at 40s<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.700 - 00:12:01.500</b><br></p><p><b>00:12:02.066 - 00:12:04.166</b><br>and it dropped all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:12:05.300 - 00:12:06.933</b><br>quadruple 0 3<br></p><p><b>00:12:07.333 - 00:12:12.533</b><br>so 3 3 all the way back up to 4 so 10 times your money<br></p><p><b>00:12:13.366 - 00:12:14.900</b><br>so anything you would have layered in here<br></p><p><b>00:12:14.900 - 00:12:15.533</b><br>and you can see I<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.533 - 00:12:17.333</b><br>still have my retorsal set up in there<br></p><p><b>00:12:17.700 - 00:12:19.166</b><br>I had to zoom in for you to really be<br></p><p><b>00:12:19.166 - 00:12:20.500</b><br>able to see this because this is<br></p><p><b>00:12:20.600 - 00:12:24.866</b><br>a month back but anyway there's 10 times your money<br></p><p><b>00:12:25.100 - 00:12:27.800</b><br>so you can easily sell like I said<br></p><p><b>00:12:28.066 - 00:12:29.900</b><br>half or more and keep the rest<br></p><p><b>00:12:29.900 - 00:12:32.600</b><br>and then look at how the story unveils<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.566 - 00:12:34.900</b><br>from there just<br></p><p><b>00:12:35.533 - 00:12:37.533</b><br>the coins that I own just keep on going up<br></p><p><b>00:12:37.533 - 00:12:39.133</b><br>my free coins keep on going up and<br></p><p><b>00:12:39.133 - 00:12:40.733</b><br>value up and value up and value<br></p><p><b>00:12:41.500 - 00:12:42.866</b><br>so anyway basically that's just<br></p><p><b>00:12:42.866 - 00:12:44.866</b><br>another way that I pick up free coins<br></p><p><b>00:12:45.166 - 00:12:46.700</b><br>you know it's a simple strategy<br></p><p><b>00:12:46.733 - 00:12:50.100</b><br>unfortunately it requires that you put bids on that<br></p><p><b>00:12:50.266 - 00:12:51.766</b><br>might sit there for months<br></p><p><b>00:12:52.400 - 00:12:53.366</b><br>but if you get<br></p><p><b>00:12:53.366 - 00:12:56.000</b><br>like I really should take my bids off that cob<br></p><p><b>00:12:56.400 - 00:12:59.300</b><br>coin because now it's been a few months now so<br></p><p><b>00:12:59.600 - 00:13:00.466</b><br>it's not likely<br></p><p><b>00:13:00.900 - 00:13:03.266</b><br>no orders are likely going to overwhelm the book<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.333 - 00:13:05.300</b><br>but the strategy is basically you're looking for<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.300 - 00:13:06.533</b><br>exchanges that have<br></p><p><b>00:13:08.000 - 00:13:10.766</b><br>very low volumes and then you<br></p><p><b>00:13:10.766 - 00:13:12.466</b><br>take a look at their books and you see that they're<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.466 - 00:13:13.866</b><br>extremely thin and they're<br></p><p><b>00:13:13.866 - 00:13:15.400</b><br>likely going to collapse<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.400 - 00:13:17.733</b><br>if anybody tries to sell a large order on<br></p><p><b>00:13:17.733 - 00:13:18.700</b><br>to their book<br></p><p><b>00:13:19.300 - 00:13:20.500</b><br>and that gives you the<br></p><p><b>00:13:20.500 - 00:13:23.266</b><br>chance to maybe get something at 1/10 of the price<br></p><p><b>00:13:23.266 - 00:13:24.566</b><br>and good coins<br></p><p><b>00:13:24.600 - 00:13:27.400</b><br>like I got Dragon Chain the other day and that was<br></p><p><b>00:13:27.700 - 00:13:30.000</b><br>I mean it was ridiculous I think I got<br></p><p><b>00:13:30.200 - 00:13:32.366</b><br>it for 1/6 of the price<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.200 - 00:13:36.600</b><br>and basically because you pick it up so dirt cheap<br></p><p><b>00:13:36.733 - 00:13:38.533</b><br>you're able to sell it immediately<br></p><p><b>00:13:38.533 - 00:13:39.866</b><br>within a few minutes<br></p><p><b>00:13:39.966 - 00:13:42.000</b><br>you can sell half your coins and get<br></p><p><b>00:13:42.000 - 00:13:43.333</b><br>all of your money back<br></p><p><b>00:13:43.533 - 00:13:44.366</b><br>plus<br></p><p><b>00:13:45.066 - 00:13:47.166</b><br>some profit on top of it<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.400 - 00:13:48.900</b><br>and you get to keep those coins<br></p><p><b>00:13:48.900 - 00:13:50.733</b><br>and then if you don't like that exchange<br></p><p><b>00:13:50.733 - 00:13:52.400</b><br>you can just transfer those coins from that<br></p><p><b>00:13:52.400 - 00:13:54.766</b><br>exchange into whatever wallet you want to use<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.900 - 00:13:58.166</b><br>and hold them in there is free coins<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.333 - 00:14:00.700</b><br>just sitting out there for you guys to grab if you<br></p><p><b>00:14:00.700 - 00:14:02.066</b><br>utilize this strategy<br></p><p><b>00:14:03.533 - 00:14:06.700</b><br>so again I would like to apologize that I'm not on<br></p><p><b>00:14:06.700 - 00:14:09.500</b><br>Slack or on discord as much as I used to be<br></p><p><b>00:14:09.533 - 00:14:11.600</b><br>or even my own steam it page<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.966 - 00:14:13.533</b><br>I'm just not paying attention<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.600 - 00:14:16.300</b><br>because I have other projects on the go right now<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.733 - 00:14:18.200</b><br>not only am I trading<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.200 - 00:14:19.966</b><br>like crazy on the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.966 - 00:14:20.133</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:14:20.133 - 00:14:22.766</b><br>I developed a brand new scanner for the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:14:23.366 - 00:14:25.500</b><br>oh my goodness it's just fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:14:25.500 - 00:14:26.300</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.566 - 00:14:27.533</b><br>let's not get off course<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.533 - 00:14:30.400</b><br>plus I got another project on the go for crypto<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.300 - 00:14:33.500</b><br>that I'll be talking about later with you guys<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.733 - 00:14:34.500</b><br>that I'm<br></p><p><b>00:14:34.500 - 00:14:37.400</b><br>very excited about but I'm working really hard on it so<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.933 - 00:14:38.933</b><br>just bear with me<br></p><p><b>00:14:41.400 - 00:14:42.300</b><br>also I'm going to try<br></p><p><b>00:14:42.300 - 00:14:44.500</b><br>to get back to making more regular videos<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.500 - 00:14:47.800</b><br>for you guys just bear in mind that the participation<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.000 - 00:14:49.866</b><br>in the cryptomarket is slow<br></p><p><b>00:14:50.600 - 00:14:53.166</b><br>and therefore I'm not participating as much<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.500 - 00:14:55.333</b><br>and so I don't really have as much to talk<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.333 - 00:14:56.000</b><br>about with you guys<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.000 - 00:14:57.333</b><br>you already know my strategies<br></p><p><b>00:14:57.933 - 00:15:00.733</b><br>but whenever I receive a question from you guys that<br></p><p><b>00:15:01.066 - 00:15:02.566</b><br>deserves discussion<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.800 - 00:15:04.266</b><br>then I will make a video<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.266 - 00:15:05.933</b><br>and whenever I can think of<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.000 - 00:15:07.733</b><br>a strategy that I'm using<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.733 - 00:15:09.800</b><br>that you guys might benefit from<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.900 - 00:15:11.066</b><br>I will make a video<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.100 - 00:15:14.400</b><br>and of course later on when you know<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.933 - 00:15:15.733</b><br>my<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.066 - 00:15:17.500</b><br>little crypto project that I'm working on<br></p><p><b>00:15:17.500 - 00:15:19.100</b><br>has developed a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:15:19.333 - 00:15:21.066</b><br>then I think that will be<br></p><p><b>00:15:21.200 - 00:15:23.000</b><br>something everybody is going to want to know about<br></p></body></html>
