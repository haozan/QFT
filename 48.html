00:00:07.300</b><br>I have made a video in E just<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.566 - 00:00:09.733</b><br>this is ridiculous probably been over a year here<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.733 - 00:00:10.566</b><br>let me just check<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.866 - 00:00:11.533</b><br>yeah<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.533 - 00:00:13.600</b><br>definitely over one year ago<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.300 - 00:00:16.266</b><br>and as you can see my surroundings have changed<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.266 - 00:00:18.466</b><br>I'm in a different office I actually moved<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.466 - 00:00:20.766</b><br>I sold my house I bought a fixed upper<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.000 - 00:00:23.666</b><br>and it was a three year abandoned house<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.666 - 00:00:25.966</b><br>so it had tons of work that had to be done<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.966 - 00:00:28.300</b><br>nobody had been living in there for three years<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.100 - 00:00:30.966</b><br>and of course you're still seeing me on the<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.166 - 00:00:31.666</b><br>same<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.666 - 00:00:33.766</b><br>old crappy camera that I had a year ago<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.766 - 00:00:35.566</b><br>I dug that out of the drawer<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.000 - 00:00:38.533</b><br>and I didn't even really dust it off<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.533 - 00:00:41.200</b><br>so my picture quality might not be awesome<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.200 - 00:00:41.666</b><br>I've got<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.666 - 00:00:43.866</b><br>lamps around me to try to give me a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.866 - 00:00:47.400</b><br>light but again this office is not completely finished<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.566 - 00:00:51.566</b><br>so I apologize for the video quality of me<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.200 - 00:00:53.800</b><br>in the corner of the screen<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.900 - 00:00:54.966</b><br>so why am I back<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.100 - 00:00:57.200</b><br>why after a year am I making a video again<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.566 - 00:00:59.133</b><br>and am I gonna start<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.200 - 00:01:01.200</b><br>making videos on a regular basis again<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.133 - 00:01:03.533</b><br>for those of you who don't<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.533 - 00:01:04.333</b><br>know me<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.500 - 00:01:07.366</b><br>I started trading in 2006<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.666 - 00:01:09.766</b><br>I mainly trained the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.066 - 00:01:11.800</b><br>I traded a little bit of crypto to<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.466 - 00:01:14.133</b><br>and I made most of my videos about<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.133 - 00:01:16.333</b><br>crypto because there was a huge edge<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.333 - 00:01:18.666</b><br>in crypto when it was a brand new market<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.666 - 00:01:21.266</b><br>it was really whippy and there wasn't a lot of<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.333 - 00:01:22.200</b><br>algos<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.200 - 00:01:24.866</b><br>not a lot of computer trading going on there<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.566 - 00:01:27.566</b><br>and so it gave us a chance to really<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.566 - 00:01:30.533</b><br>you're trading against novices and gave us a real good<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.866 - 00:01:32.000</b><br>chance to have<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.300 - 00:01:33.166</b><br>an upper hand<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.166 - 00:01:35.933</b><br>have an advantage to have an edge on the market<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.000 - 00:01:37.500</b><br>and that really was an edge<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.500 - 00:01:39.066</b><br>that I could share with everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.400 - 00:01:42.800</b><br>the cryptocurrency base trading strategy<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.366 - 00:01:44.200</b><br>type of edge<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.200 - 00:01:46.600</b><br>was one that I could share with everyone because<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.966 - 00:01:51.666</b><br>those computers weren't there stopping the long wicks<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.766 - 00:01:54.066</b><br>they weren't there chewing up everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.133 - 00:01:56.300</b><br>trying to market make this market<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.933 - 00:01:59.933</b><br>so it gave a chance for us to<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.000 - 00:02:01.333</b><br>if you figured out that<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.366 - 00:02:03.733</b><br>strategy you'd be able to really get these<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.933 - 00:02:06.800</b><br>panic drops and quick wicks back<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.000 - 00:02:07.800</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.900 - 00:02:10.133</b><br>give you a chance to make these big percentages really<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.133 - 00:02:10.966</b><br>fast<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.533 - 00:02:14.366</b><br>now I'm not suggesting that the base trading strategy<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.466 - 00:02:15.466</b><br>doesn't work anymore<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.466 - 00:02:16.600</b><br>I'm not saying that<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.666 - 00:02:18.366</b><br>I'm just saying this is more difficult<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.200 - 00:02:21.300</b><br>that there's more computers<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.300 - 00:02:22.766</b><br>that are market making the market<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.766 - 00:02:26.200</b><br>and so moves are not quite as deep often<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.733 - 00:02:28.333</b><br>they don't bounce as fast<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.966 - 00:02:31.966</b><br>there's less participation in a lot of markets now<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.933 - 00:02:34.333</b><br>a lot of coins don't have as<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.333 - 00:02:36.200</b><br>much volume as they used to have<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.900 - 00:02:37.766</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.766 - 00:02:40.366</b><br>it's a little bit more difficult<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.366 - 00:02:44.200</b><br>you know and then if you do get a really sharp dive<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.500 - 00:02:45.900</b><br>it might be news related<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.900 - 00:02:47.666</b><br>because you're used to seeing those sharp<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.666 - 00:02:49.566</b><br>dives of a year ago<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.733 - 00:02:50.733</b><br>and now<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.900 - 00:02:53.133</b><br>you see one again and you're quick to jump on it<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.133 - 00:02:54.800</b><br>but maybe that one's news related<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.933 - 00:02:59.133</b><br>because it's just not as easy to get<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.133 - 00:03:02.766</b><br>a sharp dive that doesn't have some substance behind it<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.766 - 00:03:05.466</b><br>so it's more difficult<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.466 - 00:03:06.566</b><br>so for that reason<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.933 - 00:03:09.666</b><br>and because you know also in my personal life I<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.900 - 00:03:11.000</b><br>sold my house and moved<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.000 - 00:03:14.300</b><br>and had to renovate this house and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.300 - 00:03:17.366</b><br>it's been a while since I've traded cryptocurrencies<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.566 - 00:03:20.166</b><br>I've gone back almost 100 percent<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.400 - 00:03:21.200</b><br>to<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.800 - 00:03:22.866</b><br>trading stock market<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.600 - 00:03:26.733</b><br>okay so returning to the theme of our video today<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.866 - 00:03:29.166</b><br>we're talking about an edge in the market<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.266 - 00:03:30.066</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.800 - 00:03:34.866</b><br>over my trading career as a full time trader<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.066 - 00:03:36.200</b><br>I've gone from<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.200 - 00:03:37.966</b><br>edge that stopped working to<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.966 - 00:03:39.266</b><br>edge that stopped working to<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.266 - 00:03:41.166</b><br>edge to edge to edge to edge<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.700 - 00:03:43.866</b><br>and that's really what you got to do with a traitor<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.866 - 00:03:46.400</b><br>you have to find something that works<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.466 - 00:03:48.666</b><br>that you can really exploit and get<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.900 - 00:03:50.566</b><br>as much money as you can out of that<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.700 - 00:03:51.600</b><br>but at the same<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.600 - 00:03:54.200</b><br>time you have to always be looking for the next edge<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.266 - 00:03:57.500</b><br>there's always something else that because this one<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.700 - 00:03:59.266</b><br>the one you're using right now which<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.266 - 00:04:01.000</b><br>can sometimes be a money train<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.666 - 00:04:03.933</b><br>all of a sudden starts to not work anymore<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.933 - 00:04:05.333</b><br>as people figure it out<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.500 - 00:04:08.133</b><br>or as maybe that edge gets changed<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.933 - 00:04:11.400</b><br>there's some kind of rule change or something happens<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.400 - 00:04:12.266</b><br>you're broker<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.400 - 00:04:15.500</b><br>and eventually that drops off<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.533 - 00:04:17.400</b><br>and then you need that next one<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.466 - 00:04:19.733</b><br>so often I'll have one or two things going<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.733 - 00:04:20.800</b><br>at the same time<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.866 - 00:04:22.866</b><br>and when one of them starts to fade away<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.900 - 00:04:25.700</b><br>then I can start trading this other trade for a while<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.000 - 00:04:26.900</b><br>meanwhile<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.366 - 00:04:29.933</b><br>what I'd like to go over with you guys is my<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.966 - 00:04:34.366</b><br>my routine of finding these edges<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.133 - 00:04:35.933</b><br>but meanwhile anyway<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.933 - 00:04:38.000</b><br>you always got to be looking for the next edge<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.000 - 00:04:39.900</b><br>while you're using the one you have right now<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.500 - 00:04:41.766</b><br>the other night when I was<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.866 - 00:04:43.200</b><br>working on when I<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.266 - 00:04:45.200</b><br>think brainstorming about this video<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.266 - 00:04:47.266</b><br>I made a list<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.266 - 00:04:48.100</b><br>of you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.100 - 00:04:49.766</b><br>I just started thinking about all the different<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.766 - 00:04:51.200</b><br>edges that I've gone through<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.300 - 00:04:53.533</b><br>in the past few years and<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.666 - 00:04:55.800</b><br>it ended up being kind of a long list<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.900 - 00:04:59.166</b><br>I don't know if we have time to go through all of these<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.166 - 00:05:01.500</b><br>but I'll go through a few so you guys have examples<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.266 - 00:05:03.766</b><br>but one of the reasons<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.766 - 00:05:05.100</b><br>two reasons I'm making this video<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.100 - 00:05:06.600</b><br>one is to help people<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.733 - 00:05:09.133</b><br>to think about how to get an edge and what kind of<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.133 - 00:05:10.866</b><br>edges have worked in the past<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.866 - 00:05:11.966</b><br>and so forth and<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.966 - 00:05:13.766</b><br>what kind of routine they could develop<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.400 - 00:05:15.666</b><br>to be able to find these edges<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.666 - 00:05:18.100</b><br>and second thing is I need help with something<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.933 - 00:05:20.733</b><br>back<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.866 - 00:05:21.666</b><br>when<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.400 - 00:05:23.300</b><br>a year ago<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.533 - 00:05:26.600</b><br>when I was heavily trading cryptos all the time<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.300 - 00:05:31.366</b><br>me and a group of guys got together<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.500 - 00:05:33.600</b><br>and we started to develop a tool<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.466 - 00:05:37.366</b><br>that we hoped to give a good edge to everybody who<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.366 - 00:05:38.166</b><br>would use it<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.666 - 00:05:39.400</b><br>I don't want to go<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.400 - 00:05:42.100</b><br>into the nuts and bolts of this tool just yet<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.766 - 00:05:44.333</b><br>I want to do a video just for that<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.566 - 00:05:46.366</b><br>when we actually launch the tool<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.500 - 00:05:48.533</b><br>by the devs have let me know now that<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.533 - 00:05:50.733</b><br>they feel we're ready for a data test<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.733 - 00:05:53.866</b><br>so at the end of this video we'll discuss this<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.866 - 00:05:54.866</b><br>a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.566 -

00:07:25.866</b><br>as in the penny stocks<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.866 - 00:07:26.800</b><br>and I also like<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.200 - 00:07:29.300</b><br>the percentages that I get in penny stocks<br></p><p><b>00:07:29.300 -

00:07:35.766</b><br>20 cents<br></p><p><b>00:07:35.766 - 00:07:39.133</b><br>real easy you know 30 cents and selling it at 60 cents<br></p><p><b>00:07:39.133 - 00:07:39.766</b><br>those<br></p><p><b>00:07:39.766 -

00:08:00.966</b><br>but it's rare<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.100 - 00:08:02.400</b><br>in comparison<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.666 - 00:08:04.300</b><br>to in penny stocks<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.300 - 00:08:06.400</b><br>something going from 10 cents to 20 cents<br></p><p><b>00:08:06.400 -

00:08:15.800</b><br>you have a hard time taking size<br></p><p><b>00:08:15.966 - 00:08:18.466</b><br>really hard getting size on because<br></p><p><b>00:08:18.733 - 00:08:20.300</b><br>you'll influence the price<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.333 - 00:08:23.600</b><br>whereas once you get up there in the five dollar socks<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.500 - 00:08:25.933</b><br>you're just not big<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.933 - 00:08:29.100</b><br>enough to really affect the price very much and so<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.266 - 00:08:32.066</b><br>I just like<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.366 - 00:08:34.900</b><br>anyway so most of these examples will have to do with<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.900 - 00:08:35.800</b><br>Penn stocks<br></p><p><b>00:08:36.133 - 00:08:37.766</b><br>so one of the first advantages I got<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.766 - 00:08:40.066</b><br>when I started trading penny stocks was<br></p><p><b>00:08:40.900 - 00:08:43.133</b><br>using Interactive Brokers as a broker<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.266 - 00:08:44.166</b><br>they had something<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.666 - 00:08:46.300</b><br>that other brokers didn't have in it<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.500 - 00:08:48.766</b><br>what I called it was look back level to<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.733 - 00:08:50.666</b><br>basically<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.566 - 00:08:53.566</b><br>if you looked back on a chart<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.800 - 00:08:55.466</b><br>you'd be able to let's say<br></p><p><b>00:08:55.566 - 00:08:56.300</b><br>you had<br></p><p><b>00:08:56.300 - 00:08:57.866</b><br>you know two weeks of data<br></p><p><b>00:08:58.400 - 00:08:59.566</b><br>and the charts going<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.300 - 00:09:01.800</b><br>here let me just draw this out<br></p><p><b>00:09:02.466 - 00:09:04.700</b><br>okay so here's you know what this is silly<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.700 - 00:09:05.966</b><br>let me just get a real chart<br></p><p><b>00:09:06.800 - 00:09:07.100</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.100 - 00:09:10.066</b><br>so let's use Generation Hemp Incorporated as our<br></p><p><b>00:09:10.066 - 00:09:12.700</b><br>example here so let's say you were trading<br></p><p><b>00:09:13.100 - 00:09:13.966</b><br>Gen H<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.566 - 00:09:17.166</b><br>and it's going back and forth back and forth giving you<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.166 - 00:09:20.300</b><br>you know from 32 to 55<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.566 - 00:09:22.100</b><br>you know 32 to 60<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.100 - 00:09:23.133</b><br>so this is a good<br></p><p><b>00:09:23.133 - 00:09:24.933</b><br>example of what I was talking about how in<br></p><p><b>00:09:24.933 - 00:09:27.366</b><br>penny stocks you know you're making almost<br></p><p><b>00:09:27.766 - 00:09:29.966</b><br>100 percent every time back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.100 - 00:09:31.800</b><br>now let's say this thing dropped all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:09:31.800 - 00:09:33.766</b><br>all the way down to 10 cents<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.766 - 00:09:34.766</b><br>I know I'm in the way<br></p><p><b>00:09:35.200 - 00:09:36.366</b><br>let's say it was to drop<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.566 - 00:09:39.466</b><br>all the way down here to 10 cents all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:09:40.800 - 00:09:42.133</b><br>with this look back<br></p><p><b>00:09:42.500 - 00:09:43.300</b><br>thing<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.366 - 00:09:45.266</b><br>basically with this brokerage<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.266 - 00:09:47.566</b><br>you were able to go and pick a spot on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.566 - 00:09:48.733</b><br>like let's say over here<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.733 - 00:09:49.866</b><br>and click on it<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.866 - 00:09:53.366</b><br>and see the bit in the ass at that point in time<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.600 - 00:09:55.133</b><br>so if I was to go back<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.700 - 00:09:57.900</b><br>all the way to February 1st<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.066 - 00:10:00.000</b><br>and I just click on the chart right here<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.133 - 00:10:01.966</b><br>a level 2 would pop up<br></p><p><b>00:10:02.100 - 00:10:03.766</b><br>of that moment in time<br></p><p><b>00:10:03.766 - 00:10:07.566</b><br>and show me what the market was back then now<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.000 - 00:10:08.466</b><br>what<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.466 - 00:10:11.333</b><br>usually will happen on a stock like this is you'd have<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.400 - 00:10:12.900</b><br>a huge amount<br></p><p><b>00:10:13.100 - 00:10:13.900</b><br>of<br></p><p><b>00:10:14.466 - 00:10:16.366</b><br>a buyer sitting at the bid<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.533 - 00:10:17.600</b><br>you know maybe like<br></p><p><b>00:10:18.166 - 00:10:21.566</b><br>40 thousand shares wanting to be bought at the bid here<br></p><p><b>00:10:21.566 - 00:10:22.566</b><br>at 35<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.733 - 00:10:24.700</b><br>and maybe you know 15<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.700 - 00:10:27.733</b><br>thousand shares at the ask here at 55<br></p><p><b>00:10:28.666 - 00:10:30.300</b><br>so you'd be able to see<br></p><p><b>00:10:30.300 - 00:10:32.100</b><br>you'd be able to go back in time and see<br></p><p><b>00:10:32.300 - 00:10:36.333</b><br>how much support was at was there at 35 in the past<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.333 - 00:10:39.266</b><br>how much support over here was there at 35 in the past<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.266 - 00:10:41.800</b><br>and now all of sudden this thing drops down to ten<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.366 - 00:10:43.866</b><br>and it gives you a read<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.866 - 00:10:45.066</b><br>you'd be able to say<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.066 - 00:10:45.566</b><br>you know what<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.566 - 00:10:47.600</b><br>there's so many people that wanted to buy it<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.600 - 00:10:48.900</b><br>all the time back here<br></p><p><b>00:10:49.300 - 00:10:50.100</b><br>I'm pretty sure<br></p><p><b>00:10:50.100 - 00:10:53.066</b><br>this drop is going to return right back up to 35<br></p><p><b>00:10:53.166 - 00:10:53.966</b><br>so it<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.166 - 00:10:56.666</b><br>gave me an advantage of being able to go back<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.666 - 00:10:57.700</b><br>in the past and see<br></p><p><b>00:10:57.700 - 00:10:59.866</b><br>if this was just fake movement<br></p><p><b>00:11:00.166 - 00:11:01.500</b><br>or if there was actually<br></p><p><b>00:11:01.500 - 00:11:04.900</b><br>buyers that were stepping in at 35 all the time<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.200 - 00:11:07.000</b><br>on this chart<br></p><p><b>00:11:07.000 - 00:11:08.533</b><br>maybe that wouldn't matter so much<br></p><p><b>00:11:08.533 - 00:11:10.266</b><br>because it's such an elaborate chart<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.500 - 00:11:13.000</b><br>but on charts that are more sporadic<br></p><p><b>00:11:13.266 - 00:11:13.733</b><br>where there<br></p><p><b>00:11:13.733 - 00:11:16.733</b><br>isn't this much volume sitting at the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:11:16.733 - 00:11:18.733</b><br>it helps to see what kind of support<br></p><p><b>00:11:18.733 - 00:11:20.300</b><br>there used to be in the past<br></p><p><b>00:11:20.866 - 00:11:23.600</b><br>so that was one advantage one edge that I had<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.533 - 00:11:26.166</b><br>but that didn't last very long I think<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.566 - 00:11:29.000</b><br>6 to 8 months and they got rid of that feature<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.000 - 00:11:30.700</b><br>and then I couldn't look back in the past<br></p><p><b>00:11:30.700 - 00:11:32.766</b><br>and it was much harder to read these charts<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.266 - 00:11:35.166</b><br>okay so the next edge that I found was<br></p><p><b>00:11:35.166 - 00:11:38.000</b><br>I called it the Computer Seller obvious increments<br></p><p><b>00:11:39.466 - 00:11:40.900</b><br>basically what was happening<br></p><p><b>00:11:40.933 - 00:11:43.400</b><br>for a while this doesn't happen anymore but<br></p><p><b>00:11:43.500 - 00:11:46.000</b><br>the pain stocks were so thinly traded<br></p><p><b>00:11:46.400 - 00:11:47.000</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:11:47.000 - 00:11:50.266</b><br>sometimes a broker would sell off somebody's position<br></p><p><b>00:11:50.266 -

00:14:44.566</b><br>another hit wouldn't happen<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.566 - 00:14:47.100</b><br>and I'd be like oh yeah the computer is definitely out<br></p><p><b>00:14:47.566 - 00:14:49.600</b><br>so I wouldn't even put my shares for sale<br></p><p><b>00:14:49.700 - 00:14:51.500</b><br>I would just let the computer run<br></p><p><b>00:14:52.000 - 00:14:54.133</b><br>I'd pick up as much shares as I could<br></p><p><b>00:14:54.200 - 00:14:55.333</b><br>when the computer is out<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.333 -

00:15:33.100</b><br>I would say probably a year<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.866 - 00:15:38.133</b><br>but again that was back in maybe 2008 2009<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.666 - 00:15:38.966</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.966 -

00:18:28.900</b><br>drawing implement again<br></p><p><b>00:18:29.466 - 00:18:31.200</b><br>can I start that fresh<br></p><p><b>00:18:32.166 - 00:18:32.966</b><br>let me just<br></p><p><b>00:18:33.000 - 00:18:35.266</b><br>okay so I'm using paint to<br></p><p><b>00:18:35.900 - 00:18:36.766</b><br>give you this example<br></p><p><b>00:18:36.766 - 00:18:38.300</b><br>so please forgive the fact that<br></p><p><b>00:18:38.300 -

00:18:55.800</b><br>but from 52 to 65 is like 20 percent<br></p><p><b>00:18:56.700 - 00:18:57.933</b><br>so that's the spread<br></p><p><b>00:18:58.866 - 00:19:01.700</b><br>and because this broker was giving me<br></p><p><b>00:19:02.933 -

00:19:34.500</b><br>if I just match the ask I go<br></p><p><b>00:19:34.533 - 00:19:35.300</b><br>and once I get them<br></p><p><b>00:19:35.300 - 00:19:37.400</b><br>I go and put myself for sale on the ask<br></p><p><b>00:19:37.966 - 00:19:39.400</b><br>regardless of<br></p><p><b>00:19:39.700 - 00:19:42.266</b><br>how many people are sitting at the ask waiting to<br></p><p><b>00:19:42.700 - 00:19:45.466</b><br>sell their shares I get first sell<br></p><p><b>00:19:45.566 - 00:19:48.266</b><br>I'd be first in Q on every order<br></p><p><b>00:19:48.400 - 00:19:49.333</b><br>so now<br></p><p><b>00:19:49.400 - 00:19:51.100</b><br>when you get to a chart that looks like<br></p><p><b>00:19:51.100 - 00:19:53.066</b><br>the chart that we were looking at earlier<br></p><p><b>00:19:53.566 - 00:19:54.366</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:19:55.200 - 00:19:56.300</b><br>this chart right here<br></p><p><b>00:19:57.566 - 00:19:58.866</b><br>like on a chart like this<br></p><p><b>00:19:58.866 - 00:20:01.066</b><br>as long as the spread is wide like that<br></p><p><b>00:20:01.133 - 00:20:02.533</b><br>I'd be able to go sit<br></p><p><b>00:20:02.933 - 00:20:05.900</b><br>on the bid and get my shares and I'd be able<br></p><p><b>00:20:06.100 - 00:20:08.166</b><br>to sit on the ask and sell<br></p><p><b>00:20:08.300 - 00:20:09.733</b><br>and just every time<br></p><p><b>00:20:09.933 -

00:20:17.300</b><br>or being able to sell<br></p><p><b>00:20:17.966 - 00:20:20.066</b><br>so it was just an unbelievable thing<br></p><p><b>00:20:20.066 - 00:20:22.700</b><br>and I just milked it it was such<br></p><p><b>00:20:23.066 - 00:20:24.566</b><br>a beautiful edge to have<br></p><p><b>00:20:24.666 - 00:20:28.400</b><br>and it was totally worth the $10 each way<br></p><p><b>00:20:28.533 - 00:20:30.700</b><br>you know I'd be making $100<br></p><p><b>00:20:30.733 - 00:20:33.933</b><br>each way and paying 20 bucks in commissions every time<br></p><p><b>00:20:33.933 - 00:20:35.500</b><br>over and over all day long<br></p><p><b>00:20:35.600 - 00:20:36.366</b><br>again though<br></p><p><b>00:20:36.366 - 00:20:38.300</b><br>eventually that died<br></p><p><b>00:20:38.733 - 00:20:41.266</b><br>you know his execution stopped working and then I<br></p><p><b>00:20:41.266 - 00:20:42.466</b><br>found another brokering<br></p><p><b>00:20:43.500 - 00:20:45.933</b><br>okay so the next edge was another broker edge<br></p><p><b>00:20:45.966 - 00:20:48.666</b><br>I called it the invisible Middle price Broker<br></p><p><b>00:20:49.533 - 00:20:50.700</b><br>so basically<br></p><p><b>00:20:51.666 - 00:20:56.333</b><br>okay so let's say the bid is 20 and the ask is 25<br></p><p><b>00:20:58.100 - 00:20:59.466</b><br>what happens in<br></p><p><b>00:20:59.900 - 00:21:02.500</b><br>the stock market for these smaller price<br></p><p><b>00:21:03.100 -

00:21:12.066</b><br>fulfill these amounts<br></p><p><b>00:21:12.066 - 00:21:14.666</b><br>so if the price is over $1<br></p><p><b>00:21:14.966 - 00:21:18.500</b><br>you have to at least try to buy or at least try to sell<br></p><p><b>00:21:18.500 -

00:24:36.800</b><br>able to be invisible<br></p><p><b>00:24:37.200 - 00:24:38.266</b><br>on the market<br></p><p><b>00:24:39.133 - 00:24:41.766</b><br>and because the brokerage is so big with<br></p><p><b>00:24:41.766 - 00:24:44.000</b><br>millions and millions of clients<br></p><p><b>00:24:44.366 - 00:24:45.900</b><br>I would get executed<br></p><p><b>00:24:46.900 - 00:24:50.000</b><br>without even being affected on the market and I get<br></p><p><b>00:24:50.000 - 00:24:51.666</b><br>executed at the higher prices<br></p><p><b>00:24:51.666 - 00:24:53.466</b><br>I buy at the lower prices and get<br></p><p><b>00:24:53.466 - 00:24:55.100</b><br>executed at the higher prices<br></p><p><b>00:24:55.566 - 00:24:57.333</b><br>I don't want to spend too much time on this because<br></p><p><b>00:24:57.333 - 00:24:58.866</b><br>that's a hard explanation<br></p><p><b>00:24:59.000 - 00:25:02.500</b><br>but it was such a huge advantage<br></p><p><b>00:25:02.533 - 00:25:03.200</b><br>so the next one<br></p><p><b>00:25:03.200 - 00:25:04.766</b><br>most of you are all familiar with the new<br></p><p><b>00:25:04.766 - 00:25:06.400</b><br>cryptocurrency market you know when<br></p><p><b>00:25:06.400 - 00:25:08.533</b><br>Bitcoin and all the other coins started coming out<br></p><p><b>00:25:08.733 - 00:25:12.166</b><br>and it was all novice traders and there was lots of<br></p><p><b>00:25:12.166 - 00:25:14.133</b><br>swings and lots of movement<br></p><p><b>00:25:14.533 - 00:25:16.566</b><br>and I try to create<br></p><p><b>00:25:17.666 - 00:25:19.400</b><br>a simple system for everybody<br></p><p><b>00:25:19.400 - 00:25:21.733</b><br>of the broken bases on panic drops and stuff<br></p><p><b>00:25:21.733 - 00:25:22.400</b><br>something that<br></p><p><b>00:25:22.400 - 00:25:23.200</b><br>everybody could do<br></p><p><b>00:25:23.200 - 00:25:25.200</b><br>and really grow their account quickly<br></p><p><b>00:25:25.900 - 00:25:26.800</b><br>so yeah<br></p><p><b>00:25:26.900 - 00:25:29.133</b><br>we don't really have to go into that there's a lot of<br></p><p><b>00:25:29.333 - 00:25:32.533</b><br>fat finger trades and all kinds of things you could do<br></p><p><b>00:25:32.533 - 00:25:33.533</b><br>within this market<br></p><p><b>00:25:33.533 - 00:25:35.466</b><br>because it was a brand new market<br></p><p><b>00:25:35.966 - 00:25:36.666</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:25:36.666 - 00:25:39.266</b><br>the next one is called short selling Nasdaqs and that<br></p><p><b>00:25:39.300 - 00:25:41.333</b><br>a lot of people are still doing right now<br></p><p><b>00:25:42.133 - 00:25:44.100</b><br>and you know there was a really big<br></p><p><b>00:25:44.100 - 00:25:45.800</b><br>edge before because only<br></p><p><b>00:25:45.866 - 00:25:48.400</b><br>few brokers had shares to short<br></p><p><b>00:25:48.500 - 00:25:51.466</b><br>had a short list that you could borrow from<br></p><p><b>00:25:52.300 - 00:25:53.866</b><br>and so only if you<br></p><p><b>00:25:53.966 - 00:25:54.966</b><br>happen to get<br></p><p><b>00:25:54.966 - 00:25:56.500</b><br>with those new brokers were you<br></p><p><b>00:25:56.500 - 00:25:59.266</b><br>able to see something that was just going parabolic<br></p><p><b>00:25:59.333 - 00:26:02.666</b><br>and short into it and get a quick drop and<br></p><p><b>00:26:03.133 - 00:26:04.266</b><br>there's still a lot<br></p><p><b>00:26:04.266 - 00:26:07.000</b><br>of traders out there that are short selling NASDAQs<br></p><p><b>00:26:07.533 - 00:26:10.133</b><br>off of these crazy morning spikes that happen<br></p><p><b>00:26:10.133 - 00:26:11.566</b><br>there's a lot of action<br></p><p><b>00:26:12.333 - 00:26:16.933</b><br>you know in the anywhere from $1 to $10 range<br></p><p><b>00:26:17.066 - 00:26:18.400</b><br>those type of stocks<br></p><p><b>00:26:18.400 - 00:26:20.166</b><br>that there's tons of movement<br></p><p><b>00:26:20.200 - 00:26:22.600</b><br>and there's still enough people<br></p><p><b>00:26:22.933 - 00:26:24.466</b><br>that aren't shorting them<br></p><p><b>00:26:24.733 - 00:26:26.133</b><br>you know that don't have<br></p><p><b>00:26:26.133 - 00:26:27.866</b><br>that aren't used to sorting and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:26:27.866 - 00:26:29.966</b><br>that just kind of chase prices up<br></p><p><b>00:26:30.666 - 00:26:33.166</b><br>that still make it fairly profitable<br></p><p><b>00:26:33.766 - 00:26:34.500</b><br>but it's still<br></p><p><b>00:26:34.500 - 00:26:37.000</b><br>very dangerous because there's a lot of short traps<br></p><p><b>00:26:37.000 - 00:26:39.966</b><br>and it squeezes and<br></p><p><b>00:26:40.466 - 00:26:42.933</b><br>stalks go further than you expect and people<br></p><p><b>00:26:43.333 - 00:26:44.766</b><br>lose their accounts and<br></p><p><b>00:26:44.966 - 00:26:47.066</b><br>you know they're shorting on margin accounts<br></p><p><b>00:26:47.066 - 00:26:49.300</b><br>obviously have to be a margin account short<br></p><p><b>00:26:50.000 - 00:26:51.866</b><br>so this this one was<br></p><p><b>00:26:51.933 - 00:26:54.066</b><br>a really really good edge<br></p><p><b>00:26:54.766 - 00:26:55.966</b><br>a few years back<br></p><p><b>00:26:56.066 - 00:26:59.100</b><br>and now it's starting to be not quite as good an edge<br></p><p><b>00:26:59.400 - 00:27:00.666</b><br>more and more difficult<br></p><p><b>00:27:01.166 - 00:27:02.666</b><br>this one is not the best<br></p><p><b>00:27:02.666 - 00:27:05.700</b><br>edge that I've found but I have used in the past where<br></p><p><b>00:27:06.666 - 00:27:09.166</b><br>I'll have a market scanner that<br></p><p><b>00:27:09.900 - 00:27:11.300</b><br>is within a platform<br></p><p><b>00:27:11.666 - 00:27:14.400</b><br>you know a broker's platform and they'll have<br></p><p><b>00:27:14.400 - 00:27:16.666</b><br>scanner included in their platform and you can<br></p><p><b>00:27:16.666 - 00:27:18.900</b><br>execute right off the scanner instead of having to<br></p><p><b>00:27:18.900 - 00:27:19.933</b><br>type an order in<br></p><p><b>00:27:20.100 - 00:27:21.400</b><br>and submitted order<br></p><p><b>00:27:21.666 - 00:27:23.900</b><br>when there's like a fat finger play<br></p><p><b>00:27:23.900 - 00:27:25.866</b><br>or something like that something drops really really<br></p><p><b>00:27:25.866 - 00:27:28.300</b><br>quick you're able to just see it and<br></p><p><b>00:27:28.300 - 00:27:29.900</b><br>right on the scanner execute<br></p><p><b>00:27:30.166 - 00:27:31.300</b><br>and by a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:27:32.200 - 00:27:33.166</b><br>expecting that<br></p><p><b>00:27:33.200 - 00:27:36.266</b><br>whenever there's a large drop really fast drop<br></p><p><b>00:27:36.800 - 00:27:38.933</b><br>you know maybe in all in one order<br></p><p><b>00:27:39.000 - 00:27:40.800</b><br>or all in two or three orders<br></p><p><b>00:27:41.766 - 00:27:43.266</b><br>you get a quick whip back<br></p><p><b>00:27:43.300 - 00:27:44.066</b><br>even if<br></p><p><b>00:27:44.066 - 00:27:47.200</b><br>it's news related you'll often get a quick whip back<br></p><p><b>00:27:47.533 - 00:27:49.300</b><br>before it starts to fall<br></p><p><b>00:27:50.100 - 00:27:52.566</b><br>and so I've often made money off of<br></p><p><b>00:27:52.566 - 00:27:55.066</b><br>just a market scanner on a platform<br></p><p><b>00:27:55.333 - 00:27:57.800</b><br>that allows me to execute off the scanner<br></p><p><b>00:27:58.733 - 00:28:01.366</b><br>but again it's not the best edge<br></p><p><b>00:28:01.500 - 00:28:04.200</b><br>but it's a good example of<br></p><p><b>00:28:04.866 - 00:28:06.100</b><br>technology giving you an<br></p><p><b>00:28:06.100 - 00:28:07.766</b><br>edge there's a lot of stuff in here like<br></p><p><b>00:28:07.766 - 00:28:09.133</b><br>look back level 2<br></p><p><b>00:28:09.300 - 00:28:10.100</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:28:10.966 - 00:28:12.966</b><br>obvious computer seller and<br></p><p><b>00:28:13.800 - 00:28:16.500</b><br>first in Q and middle price<br></p><p><b>00:28:16.566 - 00:28:18.933</b><br>there's a lot of them in here that are<br></p><p><b>00:28:19.866 - 00:28:22.466</b><br>edges you get from technology<br></p><p><b>00:28:22.466 - 00:28:24.933</b><br>from having better technology than the guy next to you<br></p><p><b>00:28:26.200 - 00:28:29.266</b><br>wow so this video is almost at a half hour<br></p><p><b>00:28:29.466 - 00:28:31.300</b><br>longer than I expected so you know what<br></p><p><b>00:28:31.400 - 00:28:33.066</b><br>let's make this a two part video<br></p><p><b>00:28:33.133 -

00:28:40.800</b><br>I've got a whole bunch more on the sheet<br></p><p><b>00:28:40.866 - 00:28:42.566</b><br>but let's not go over all of them<br></p><p><b>00:28:43.300 - 00:28:45.300</b><br>this just gives you some examples of the type of<br></p><p><b>00:28:45.300 - 00:28:46.333</b><br>edges that I've looked for<br></p><p><b>00:28:46.333 - 00:28:48.700</b><br>a lot of them have to do with technology<br></p><p><b>00:28:49.700 - 00:28:50.933</b><br>and what I do<br></p><p><b>00:28:50.966 - 00:28:51.900</b><br>on a daily basis<br></p><p><b>00:28:51.900 - 00:28:54.700</b><br>so part 2 will be what I do on a daily basis<br></p><p><b>00:28:55.566 - 00:28:58.400</b><br>and on a weekly basis to try to look for these edges<br></p><p><b>00:28:58.400 - 00:28:59.666</b><br>so I always have another<br></p><p><b>00:28:59.666 - 00:29:01.133</b><br>edge to follow the next edge<br></p><p><b>00:29:01.133 - 00:29:03.266</b><br>and then of course we're gonna discuss<br></p><p><b>00:29:03.333 -
