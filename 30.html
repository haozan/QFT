00:00:25.166</b><br>but it turned against me so violently<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.333 - 00:00:28.000</b><br>and I followed my rules like I always do<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.000 - 00:00:29.666</b><br>and it's a great opportunity for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.666 - 00:00:31.333</b><br>to learn a lesson on how<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.566 - 00:00:33.166</b><br>if you're trying to trade my way<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.700 - 00:00:36.733</b><br>how if you follow these rules they will save your butt<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.733 - 00:00:38.766</b><br>they will always save your butt<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.166 - 00:00:42.000</b><br>so you know most of my days are green<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.333 - 00:00:43.700</b><br>pretty well all of them are green<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.700 - 00:00:45.366</b><br>once in a blue moon<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.400 - 00:00:47.500</b><br>does a stock do something that I just<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.366 - 00:00:50.566</b><br>didn't expect to do and then this happens<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.166 - 00:00:52.866</b><br>so let's take a look at that stock<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.933 - 00:00:57.133</b><br>and it was this one right here G L<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.600 - 00:00:58.400</b><br>L K<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.066 - 00:01:01.866</b><br>and I backed it up to the time of the trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.866 - 00:01:04.400</b><br>so right here around 1145<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.500 - 00:01:06.866</b><br>you can see that the stock was up at 52<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.666 - 00:01:10.966</b><br>then it fell boom boom boom boom boom violently<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.966 - 00:01:12.800</b><br>some real crazy selling<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.800 - 00:01:13.866</b><br>now that could be<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.166 - 00:01:14.566</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.566 - 00:01:16.466</b><br>just a handful of people getting out of their position<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.466 - 00:01:19.166</b><br>like one big guy trying to unload his position<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.166 - 00:01:19.966</b><br>it could be<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.966 - 00:01:22.300</b><br>you know a few people who know something about<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.166 - 00:01:23.800</b><br>the stock<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.800 - 00:01:26.000</b><br>even though there's no use that I can find on it<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.133 - 00:01:28.266</b><br>maybe there's some insider information there<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.266 - 00:01:30.066</b><br>or there's a rumor or something<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.300 - 00:01:31.966</b><br>so the thing was falling pretty hard<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.966 - 00:01:34.766</b><br>and then you can see right here at around 2750<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.866 - 00:01:36.466</b><br>we get a little bit more volume<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.466 - 00:01:37.933</b><br>a little spike of volume there<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.266 - 00:01:39.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.466 - 00:01:40.600</b><br>that's where I got my entry<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.600 - 00:01:42.466</b><br>I thought okay well that looks good<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.466 - 00:01:44.300</b><br>I'd like to have a balance up to you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.300 - 00:01:45.566</b><br>35 or something<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.566 - 00:01:48.800</b><br>27 to 35 I mean the thing was at 52<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.966 - 00:01:52.533</b><br>so I really wasn't expecting it to continue any lower<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.533 - 00:01:53.566</b><br>but of course<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.866 - 00:01:55.666</b><br>boom<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.533 - 00:01:58.600</b><br>we go down a little bit we're at 25<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.766 - 00:02:00.500</b><br>and I'm trying to move this slowly<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.933 - 00:02:02.533</b><br>right down to 25<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.733 - 00:02:05.533</b><br>well right down to 22 50 in this point but<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.333 - 00:02:09.066</b><br>at the 25 Mark if I can get there without<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.066 - 00:02:10.166</b><br>this is really touchy<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.066 - 00:02:12.700</b><br>at the 25 Mark I<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.733 - 00:02:15.366</b><br>thought okay well I'll take a little bit more right<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.466 - 00:02:16.333</b><br>because I'm still<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.566 - 00:02:17.700</b><br>according to my rules<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.700 - 00:02:18.900</b><br>I will continue to buy<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.900 - 00:02:20.900</b><br>as long as it's on its initial move<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.133 - 00:02:23.933</b><br>so here it's still on its initial move and<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.100 - 00:02:27.466</b><br>you know at 25 we got a little bounce from 25 to 27<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.466 - 00:02:30.733</b><br>so it's starting to look like it might turn around<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.866 - 00:02:33.600</b><br>we had a small section with no volume<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.600 - 00:02:35.600</b><br>the trading kind of stopped for a second<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.600 - 00:02:37.333</b><br>and then we got a little bit of volume<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.500 - 00:02:40.133</b><br>and I bought these 25 so I'm in at 27<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.400 - 00:02:43.733</b><br>50 and 25 so my average is about 26<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.200 - 00:02:46.966</b><br>so this got to be a balance coming right<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.966 - 00:02:49.900</b><br>there's some volume here where we're starting to<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.900 - 00:02:52.566</b><br>we're starting to Peter off here at the 25 27s<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.566 - 00:02:53.900</b><br>it's starting to bounce a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.000 - 00:02:55.800</b><br>we should get a bounce right<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.300 - 00:02:58.066</b><br>like all things say<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.066 - 00:02:59.466</b><br>I can't find any news<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.466 - 00:03:01.166</b><br>all things say we should get abouts<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.333 - 00:03:04.733</b><br>and then oh all the way down to 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.966 - 00:03:06.766</b><br>so do you think I bought this 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.366 - 00:03:09.733</b><br>you know it's still not its initial move really<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.733 - 00:03:11.733</b><br>there's this little hiccup right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.266 - 00:03:14.000</b><br>but do you think about 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.100 - 00:03:18.400</b><br>nope I was in pretty big<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.300 - 00:03:20.066</b><br>at this point<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.066 - 00:03:24.200</b><br>I was in I don't know 3,000 $4,000 something like that<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.533 - 00:03:27.200</b><br>and nope no bounce<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.733 - 00:03:30.133</b><br>no bounce at the 25 layer I expected<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.133 - 00:03:31.700</b><br>no bounce at the 2750<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.700 - 00:03:32.866</b><br>like I expected<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.066 - 00:03:34.500</b><br>gets all the way down to 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.500 - 00:03:36.466</b><br>and although you can't really tell on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.466 - 00:03:38.733</b><br>that's 10 minutes of sitting down at the 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.400 - 00:03:43.100</b><br>before it gives you any kind of a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.100 - 00:03:45.300</b><br>so it bounce from 20 to 25<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.966 - 00:03:47.800</b><br>and I got out<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.066 - 00:03:49.566</b><br>I was like you know what<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.366 - 00:03:52.266</b><br>it's not reacting properly<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.466 - 00:03:56.166</b><br>look at all this extra volume that continued it lower<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.200 - 00:03:57.766</b><br>and then what do we get<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.966 - 00:04:00.933</b><br>a little 20 to 25 bounce<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.166 - 00:04:03.533</b><br>you know this thing should bounce up to 35<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.966 - 00:04:08.100</b><br>so when I saw the hesitation at 25 I just unloaded<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.200 - 00:04:10.600</b><br>I said okay it doesn't look like it's going any higher<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.733 - 00:04:11.866</b><br>I'm getting out of this thing<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.866 - 00:04:14.766</b><br>it is not the type of stock that I want to be in<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.366 - 00:04:17.866</b><br>so I took a 280 dollar loss<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.000 - 00:04:20.766</b><br>and you know I don't know how much you guys trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.766 - 00:04:21.766</b><br>that might sound like a lot to you<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.766 - 00:04:24.600</b><br>to me that's well 280 dollars is nothing<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.600 - 00:04:26.466</b><br>you know if it<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.466 - 00:04:27.133</b><br>if this had been a<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.133 - 00:04:29.366</b><br>thousand dollar loss or 15 hundred dollar loss<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.366 - 00:04:31.066</b><br>I'd have been like oh<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.600 - 00:04:32.400</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.266 - 00:04:36.100</b><br>I was quick 200 dollar loss so what happened<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.000 - 00:04:37.866</b><br>well let's see<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.866 - 00:04:39.566</b><br>so then crack<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.100 - 00:04:42.000</b><br>all the way down to 12<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.100 - 00:04:43.200</b><br>are you kidding me<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.600 - 00:04:45.500</b><br>12 15 and 12<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.066 - 00:04:48.733</b><br>so at 25 ish<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.733 - 00:04:52.100</b><br>you know I was in about four grand<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.566 - 00:04:56.133</b><br>down to 12 so at this point I'd be down<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.200 - 00:04:58.566</b><br>over $2,000 on this position<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.800 - 00:05:01.500</b><br>instead of taking instead I followed my rules<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.500 - 00:05:02.800</b><br>and my rules are<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.700 - 00:05:05.866</b><br>you get in on the initial move<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.900 - 00:05:08.766</b><br>and any bounce it gives you you get out<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.266 - 00:05:12.000</b><br>you have to participate in every bounce<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.000 - 00:05:14.933</b><br>regardless of whether it's a loss or a win<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.100 - 00:05:17.766</b><br>so I participated in this bounce<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.800 - 00:05:20.300</b><br>I did not like the way this was performing<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.300 - 00:05:22.966</b><br>I was okay with let's just take a loss<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.266 - 00:05:25.066</b><br>this happens once in a blue moon<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.166 - 00:05:29.266</b><br>I took my loss and because of that I did not suffer<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.966 - 00:05:33.700</b><br>this huge loss that would have been $2,000 or more<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.800 - 00:05:35.800</b><br>and then look at this 12 12<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.966 - 00:05:39.666</b><br>look at it just look at the volume just coming in<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.866 - 00:05:42.200</b><br>and this thing will not bounce<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.566 - 00:05:43.733</b><br>so I don't know what the news is<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.733 - 00:05:45.400</b><br>I still don't know what the news is<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.400 - 00:05:48.900</b><br>but from 55 down to 12 and still won't bounce<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.900 - 00:05:50.866</b><br>down to 11 55 here<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.600 - 00:05:53.466</b><br>still will bounce still will bounce<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.466 - 00:05:55.600</b><br>still will bounce still will bounce<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.066 - 00:05:59.600</b><br>look at that so for this to happen<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.933 - 00:06:00.866</b><br>that means that<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.866 - 00:06:03.400</b><br>there's a ton of people just selling into<br></p><p><b>00:06:03.400 - 00:06:04.566</b><br>everybody who's<br></p><p><b>00:06:04.566 - 00:06:06.666</b><br>possibly thinking about buying this thing<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.766 - 00:06:09.600</b><br>they will never let the never let the winner the<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.066 - 00:06:13.700</b><br>the buyers bounced the thing up at all at all at all<br></p><p><b>00:06:13.900 - 00:06:15.300</b><br>ugly just ugly<br></p><p><b>00:06:15.500 - 00:06:16.966</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:06:17.533 - 00:06:20.766</b><br>I am super happy that I took a 280 dollar loss<br></p><p><b>00:06:20.766 - 00:06:23.166</b><br>I know that sounds crazy but I did the right thing<br></p><p><b>00:06:23.166 - 00:06:25.200</b><br>I followed my rules in because of it<br></p><p><b>00:06:25.400 - 00:06:26.900</b><br>you know I'm still having a red day<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.900 - 00:06:29.300</b><br>because I just haven't had braime trades today<br></p><p><b>00:06:29.533 - 00:06:30.333</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:06:31.200 - 00:06:32.533</b><br>you know that was a well done trade<br></p><p><b>00:06:32.533 - 00:06:34.400</b><br>and it's a good way to learn the lesson<br></p><p><b>00:06:34.933 - 00:06:37.533</b><br>and I'll show you the trades that I did take today<br></p><p><b>00:06:40.200 - 00:06:41.200</b><br>I can grab them here<br></p><p><b>00:06:41.200 - 00:06:43.000</b><br>let me just pause the video and I'll go find<br></p><p><b>00:06:43.133 - 00:06:45.166</b><br>so I only had two other trades<br></p><p><b>00:06:45.400 - 00:06:48.566</b><br>so here mdmn<br></p><p><b>00:06:49.200 - 00:06:50.800</b><br>wow that was a really nice one<br></p><p><b>00:06:50.800 - 00:06:52.100</b><br>so if we look at<br></p><p><b>00:06:52.100 - 00:06:54.166</b><br>2 day chart just so you can see the action<br></p><p><b>00:06:54.966 - 00:06:57.700</b><br>I was able to get in here at 115<br></p><p><b>00:06:57.866 - 00:06:59.600</b><br>and sell all the way up here at<br></p><p><b>00:07:00.533 - 00:07:04.533</b><br>139 so I don't know where I am on the list here<br></p><p><b>00:07:04.933 - 00:07:08.566</b><br>right here 139 160 thousand shares so<br></p><p><b>00:07:09.366 - 00:07:10.966</b><br>that was a beautiful trade<br></p><p><b>00:07:10.966 - 00:07:13.333</b><br>and you know it still didn't make me very<br></p><p><b>00:07:13.333 - 00:07:15.333</b><br>much money because I wasn't in huge<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.400 - 00:07:16.566</b><br>so I think I made<br></p><p><b>00:07:16.566 - 00:07:19.000</b><br>you know 160 dollars off of that or something<br></p><p><b>00:07:19.666 - 00:07:22.400</b><br>so that still doesn't cover the 280 that I had lost<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.400 - 00:07:23.466</b><br>earlier in the day<br></p><p><b>00:07:24.066 - 00:07:26.100</b><br>and then another trade that I did today was<br></p><p><b>00:07:28.800 - 00:07:29.600</b><br>g<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.100 - 00:07:33.900</b><br>H H s o m s H o m s H o<br></p><p><b>00:07:34.800 - 00:07:38.400</b><br>which was a very baby trade I bought 11s and sold<br></p><p><b>00:07:38.500 - 00:07:42.500</b><br>13s so I think I made 670 bucks off that<br></p><p><b>00:07:42.566 - 00:07:44.200</b><br>so I'm still in the red for the day<br></p><p><b>00:07:45.400 - 00:07:48.400</b><br>small trades I could have easily lost<br></p><p><b>00:07:48.400 - 00:07:49.200</b><br>2000 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.200 - 00:07:51.533</b><br>earlier and I managed to do the right thing<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.466 - 00:07:53.933</b><br>so pretty good<br></p><p><b>00:07:54.866 - 00:07:57.766</b><br>looking at steam before I let you guys go I just wanted<br></p><p><b>00:07:57.866 - 00:08:00.200</b><br>to go over those lessons with you and hopefully that<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.200 - 00:08:01.300</b><br>you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.333 - 00:08:03.166</b><br>I follow my rules and that's why<br></p><p><b>00:08:03.166 - 00:08:04.600</b><br>my butt gets saved all the time<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.600 - 00:08:06.733</b><br>and that's also why I'm always making money<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.133 - 00:08:09.800</b><br>okay so for steam over here<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.933 - 00:08:11.066</b><br>which is an investment<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.066 - 00:08:13.200</b><br>so don't look at this as though it's trading<br></p><p><b>00:08:13.333 - 00:08:17.133</b><br>but look at my buy buy buy buy buy buy<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.133 - 00:08:18.466</b><br>buy meanwhile it's falling<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.300 - 00:08:21.900</b><br>and it looks like it's just about to crack those<br></p><p><b>00:08:21.900 - 00:08:23.966</b><br>20s you know and today<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.100 - 00:08:25.900</b><br>I got these three trades off<br></p><p><b>00:08:26.133 - 00:08:29.300</b><br>so I was able to get the 22s the 21s and a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:08:29.300 - 00:08:31.200</b><br>right right next to the 20s<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.366 - 00:08:33.166</b><br>so that's fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.166 - 00:08:34.133</b><br>if it cracks those 20s<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.133 - 00:08:35.600</b><br>you know I'm going to be loading up<br></p><p><b>00:08:36.166 - 00:08:38.000</b><br>am I gonna sell any of these positions<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.000 - 00:08:39.333</b><br>what what's my cell plan<br></p><p><b>00:08:39.333 - 00:08:40.966</b><br>what am I plan to do here with this<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.333 - 00:08:43.566</b><br>well first off I think that this is gonna go<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.766 - 00:08:45.000</b><br>up crazy high again<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.133 - 00:08:45.400</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.400 - 00:08:47.366</b><br>I think we're gonna be back up in the sevens before<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.366 - 00:08:48.166</b><br>you know it<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.600 - 00:08:50.366</b><br>so I'm trying to invest<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.666 - 00:08:51.466</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.900 - 00:08:53.133</b><br>I am a trader<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.133 - 00:08:55.466</b><br>so if this thing decides to give us a big<br></p><p><b>00:08:55.500 - 00:08:58.666</b><br>pop maybe up to 27 or 28 or somewhere up here<br></p><p><b>00:08:58.866 - 00:09:01.933</b><br>then like if it did that immediately up very fast pop<br></p><p><b>00:09:02.000 - 00:09:03.133</b><br>then I would sell<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.133 - 00:09:05.666</b><br>probably all of these positions that I bought<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.666 - 00:09:06.566</b><br>those ones<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.500 - 00:09:08.333</b><br>so I'd sell them<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.333 - 00:09:11.600</b><br>and be ready to reload it when it pulls back<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.266 - 00:09:14.933</b><br>but if it slowly works its way down or if it<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.933 - 00:09:16.500</b><br>cracks down here and then it<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.500 - 00:09:18.066</b><br>slowly works its way up<br></p><p><b>00:09:19.800 - 00:09:20.733</b><br>I'm not gonna touch it<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.733 - 00:09:23.200</b><br>I'm just gonna be I'll be happy to buy buy buy buy<br></p><p><b>00:09:23.200 - 00:09:24.600</b><br>I'm not gonna sell nothing<br></p><p><b>00:09:24.900 - 00:09:26.500</b><br>and I'll wait for it to get up<br></p><p><b>00:09:26.500 - 00:09:29.066</b><br>over here where I got a two bagger or a three bagger<br></p><p><b>00:09:29.300 - 00:09:32.400</b><br>and then I will let go half of my position<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.566 - 00:09:34.200</b><br>be in for completely free<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.533 - 00:09:36.666</b><br>send all of that over to Steam Power<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.966 - 00:09:40.666</b><br>and have a lot more power behind my volts<br></p><p><b>00:09:40.700 - 00:09:42.933</b><br>which is going really good right now actually<br></p><p><b>00:09:44.933 -
