00:00:05.666</b><br>I only made a few hundred dollars in<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.866 - 00:00:06.900</b><br>the stock market today<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.900 - 00:00:08.666</b><br>so there's really not much happening<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.866 - 00:00:11.466</b><br>so I just thought I'd make a quick video for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.466 - 00:00:12.500</b><br>I realized<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.500 - 00:00:14.533</b><br>there's not much subject matter here for me to cover<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.533 - 00:00:15.066</b><br>because you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.066 - 00:00:16.300</b><br>have seen my method<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.300 - 00:00:18.866</b><br>you understand it by now if you watch the videos<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.066 - 00:00:21.966</b><br>so there's not really much left for me to talk about<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.366 - 00:00:24.733</b><br>I think maybe in this video I'll go over<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.300 - 00:00:25.966</b><br>my favorites<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.966 - 00:00:28.900</b><br>let's just go through my favorites list and we can<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.100 - 00:00:30.400</b><br>take a look at the trades that I made<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.400 - 00:00:32.400</b><br>whatever little arrows there are on the screen<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.500 - 00:00:34.300</b><br>oh by the way here on Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.300 - 00:00:36.900</b><br>you can see that I sold some at that 35 level<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.366 - 00:00:39.866</b><br>I don't usually sell bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.866 - 00:00:41.933</b><br>I have a lot of bitcoin but I don't sell them<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.933 - 00:00:43.666</b><br>I'm holding them because I believe<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.966 - 00:00:45.600</b><br>bitcoin is going to go to the moon<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.766 - 00:00:50.133</b><br>but I decided to sell at the 35 level as a traitor<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.133 - 00:00:51.300</b><br>not my method<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.300 - 00:00:51.800</b><br>this is not an<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.800 - 00:00:53.866</b><br>example of my method or anything like that<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.400 - 00:00:57.700</b><br>just as a traitor I know that the 3000 level<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.966 - 00:00:58.600</b><br>see<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.600 - 00:01:02.866</b><br>2929 2930 2940<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.133 - 00:01:06.100</b><br>that 3,000 level is a level that matters to people<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.100 - 00:01:07.866</b><br>when you break through the 3,000 level<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.866 - 00:01:09.700</b><br>that's why you get these big run UPS<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.900 - 00:01:12.100</b><br>and then 35 again<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.266 - 00:01:15.166</b><br>another level and 4000 another level and 45<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.166 - 00:01:16.066</b><br>another level and<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.166 - 00:01:18.133</b><br>you know those are psychological levels<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.133 - 00:01:21.166</b><br>so just because of my experience as a trader<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.466 - 00:01:24.333</b><br>when we hit that 35 I was like oh man I<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.366 - 00:01:26.000</b><br>got to sell some here just<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.300 - 00:01:27.766</b><br>you know just to make a little dip<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.766 - 00:01:30.000</b><br>so this buy right here at 32<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.000 - 00:01:31.966</b><br>that's not my method that's just<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.066 - 00:01:33.533</b><br>I sold some at 35<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.533 - 00:01:35.266</b><br>so I'm buying them back at 32<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.266 - 00:01:36.733</b><br>because I really want to hold it<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.900 - 00:01:39.700</b><br>so I'm buying 32s and 31s and 30s and<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.866 - 00:01:40.666</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.800 - 00:01:43.266</b><br>on this little pullback I'll buy so that I can<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.333 - 00:01:46.266</b><br>be there for the long hold all the way up to<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.266 - 00:01:47.866</b><br>5000 or wherever we're going<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.800 - 00:01:49.600</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.733 - 00:01:52.700</b><br>that 35 is just a psychological level<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.700 - 00:01:54.200</b><br>and you know that almost<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.200 - 00:01:56.600</b><br>every time it's going to<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.366 - 00:01:58.266</b><br>give us a dip<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.800 - 00:02:00.300</b><br>now mind you how<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.966 - 00:02:01.333</b><br>did<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.333 - 00:02:05.766</b><br>I sold this 35 and then right away we hit 3550<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.866 - 00:02:08.333</b><br>we get a little bit pull back back to 35<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.333 - 00:02:10.166</b><br>we go back to 3550<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.266 - 00:02:12.533</b><br>if it started to do that kind of business<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.333 - 00:02:15.400</b><br>I would just just buy right back in<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.400 - 00:02:17.500</b><br>I would assume that little 50<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.500 - 00:02:20.666</b><br>dollar loss and I would just let the whole thing ride<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.000 - 00:02:24.333</b><br>but instead I just sold it 35 and<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.533 - 00:02:25.733</b><br>to see what was going to happen<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.733 - 00:02:27.933</b><br>and what I thought would happen happened<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.000 - 00:02:31.300</b><br>we got a little pull back a retest of the 35<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.300 - 00:02:33.200</b><br>and then it starts to fall off<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.866 - 00:02:35.500</b><br>so that's just typical trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.766 - 00:02:37.366</b><br>so yeah like I was thinking<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.566 - 00:02:39.566</b><br>maybe we could just go through my favorites list<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.700 - 00:02:40.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.000 - 00:02:42.733</b><br>just to work clear just<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.133 - 00:02:45.133</b><br>while we're just shooting the breeze here<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.166 - 00:02:48.700</b><br>my main money<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.466 - 00:02:50.500</b><br>other than the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.500 - 00:02:51.700</b><br>forget about the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.900 - 00:02:54.900</b><br>my main money is the bigger trades right<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.900 - 00:02:56.266</b><br>the position size<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.733 - 00:03:00.466</b><br>trades so like all this Ethereum stuff where is it<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.000 - 00:03:03.300</b><br>I can't move<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.800 - 00:03:07.866</b><br>Ethereum where are you right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.466 - 00:03:09.266</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.766 - 00:03:10.766</b><br>let's zoom out<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.266 - 00:03:14.300</b><br>so you can see<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.566 - 00:03:16.300</b><br>once this thing catches up<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.400 - 00:03:19.900</b><br>so I had to pause the video there for a second<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.900 - 00:03:20.866</b><br>sorry about that<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.266 - 00:03:23.333</b><br>it's because Kenigi sometimes takes time<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.533 - 00:03:25.500</b><br>on catching up and showing these arrows<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.500 - 00:03:26.166</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.166 - 00:03:29.866</b><br>anyway you can see my point is that Ethereum Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.866 - 00:03:33.200</b><br>bigger coins that's where I take my bigger traits and<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.300 - 00:03:34.700</b><br>that's where I make all my money<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.466 - 00:03:37.200</b><br>all the little trades<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.200 - 00:03:38.800</b><br>all the smaller coins<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.800 - 00:03:41.600</b><br>I trade smaller right you can't get in as big<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.766 - 00:03:44.933</b><br>some of them you can but they're just not as<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.566 - 00:03:46.500</b><br>for sure a thing<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.500 - 00:03:49.133</b><br>like if I was to go away on vacation right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.133 - 00:03:50.900</b><br>and leave my money in Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.900 - 00:03:52.366</b><br>I'd feel pretty safe<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.900 - 00:03:54.866</b><br>same thing with Bitcoin I'd feel pretty safe<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.933 - 00:03:57.066</b><br>those are the things I want to be invested in<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.100 - 00:03:57.900</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.400 - 00:03:59.100</b><br>mind you<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.100 - 00:04:02.366</b><br>of course I'm sitting on free coins like Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.366 - 00:04:05.533</b><br>I like look I haven't participated this whole run up<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.766 - 00:04:06.666</b><br>right because<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.766 - 00:04:08.166</b><br>with my method if you've been<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.166 - 00:04:09.100</b><br>following my method<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.100 - 00:04:11.766</b><br>you know that I draw bases and I buy under bases<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.766 - 00:04:13.500</b><br>so there's not really any bases here<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.666 - 00:04:16.866</b><br>so you know now it's running up and I'm sitting on<br></p><p><b>00:04:16.866 - 00:04:18.566</b><br>all those free coins<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.600 - 00:04:21.200</b><br>now I did sell some of my bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.166 - 00:04:22.966</b><br>earlier<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.400 - 00:04:25.200</b><br>at 3500 because<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.566 - 00:04:28.533</b><br>I'm sitting on all those coins and I just a<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.533 - 00:04:31.100</b><br>trader in me can't resist to make that trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.766 - 00:04:33.133</b><br>but in reality<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.600 - 00:04:36.466</b><br>you know I've profited profited profited profited<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.466 - 00:04:38.000</b><br>profited profited profited<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.066 - 00:04:41.700</b><br>and then finally now all those profits all that<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.766 - 00:04:43.566</b><br>that Ethereum that I'm sitting on<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.800 - 00:04:46.500</b><br>now starts to grow and grow and grow<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.500 - 00:04:48.066</b><br>and when it gets up to 400<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.066 - 00:04:49.600</b><br>I'm going to be sitting with<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.600 - 00:04:52.766</b><br>with some that I bought at 135<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.133 - 00:04:54.333</b><br>to 400<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.333 - 00:04:55.133</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.000 - 00:04:59.300</b><br>so trading is just a beautiful thing and it's a gift<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.333 - 00:05:00.966</b><br>to have a market this easy<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.266 - 00:05:03.133</b><br>so anyway I was thinking we could look through<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.133 - 00:05:04.366</b><br>some of my<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.600 - 00:05:07.533</b><br>favorites<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.800 - 00:05:10.466</b><br>and just take a look at the arrows<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.533 - 00:05:12.133</b><br>just look at the trades that I've made<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.300 - 00:05:14.100</b><br>and talk about them a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.466 - 00:05:16.400</b><br>because I have a bit of free time since the market so<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.400 - 00:05:17.200</b><br>slow<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.766 - 00:05:21.866</b><br>and why you know why I trade the way I do and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.533 - 00:05:25.933</b><br>okay so starting off at the top we've got ADT<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.166 - 00:05:27.733</b><br>so you're going to see that on these charts<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.733 - 00:05:29.666</b><br>this is obviously an account building chart<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.100 - 00:05:30.800</b><br>you'll see on these charts<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.800 - 00:05:31.866</b><br>I don't take very many traits<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.866 - 00:05:34.733</b><br>I mean like look I got a trade here from 12 to 14<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.333 - 00:05:38.166</b><br>this is a great account building chart<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.166 - 00:05:39.400</b><br>you know and you could be taking trades<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.400 - 00:05:42.000</b><br>taking trades taking trades taking trades but again<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.666 - 00:05:43.066</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.066 - 00:05:44.066</b><br>I only take a<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.066 - 00:05:45.166</b><br>trade if I hear the alert<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.166 - 00:05:46.600</b><br>and I happen to be at my desk<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.866 - 00:05:47.700</b><br>otherwise<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.866 - 00:05:50.266</b><br>these little tiny things are just for fun for me<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.600 - 00:05:52.766</b><br>the big money is made in position trading so<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.566 - 00:05:55.700</b><br>yeah you won't find a lot of trades on here<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.700 - 00:05:56.566</b><br>but we can just go<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.566 - 00:05:58.166</b><br>through the charts and look to see if there was any<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.166 - 00:06:00.000</b><br>real solid awesome ones<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.000 -

00:06:36.733</b><br>that got away from me<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.266 - 00:06:39.733</b><br>and it was right around that July 1st<br></p><p><b>00:06:39.733 - 00:06:42.566</b><br>area where things just went wrong and Bitcoin was<br></p><p><b>00:06:42.566 - 00:06:44.900</b><br>crashing and so forth but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:06:45.466 - 00:06:47.200</b><br>I got in here at 14<br></p><p><b>00:06:47.200 - 00:06:48.733</b><br>and I remember I got some 14<br></p><p><b>00:06:48.733 -

00:07:04.766</b><br>and you drew this as a base<br></p><p><b>00:07:04.800 - 00:07:06.766</b><br>you'll see that when it<br></p><p><b>00:07:06.800 - 00:07:09.266</b><br>came for a bounce it did not go<br></p><p><b>00:07:09.400 - 00:07:10.000</b><br>where<br></p><p><b>00:07:10.000 - 00:07:12.900</b><br>it did not return to its base it broke the rules<br></p><p><b>00:07:12.933 - 00:07:13.766</b><br>and right here<br></p><p><b>00:07:13.766 - 00:07:17.800</b><br>when it went for a bounce it did not return to its<br></p><p><b>00:07:17.933 - 00:07:21.066</b><br>base so mind you it didn't miss it by much but<br></p><p><b>00:07:21.266 - 00:07:22.600</b><br>it didn't make it<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.600 -

00:07:48.966</b><br>showing a beautiful chart that always worked out<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.766 - 00:07:51.866</b><br>but as soon as it stops working out<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.666 - 00:07:54.166</b><br>I stop trading it<br></p><p><b>00:07:54.700 - 00:07:56.166</b><br>that's it so<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.300 - 00:07:58.933</b><br>you know after this happened and this happened<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.933 - 00:08:00.333</b><br>I got two more entries<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.333 - 00:08:02.933</b><br>once those two entries happened I'm like oh<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.966 - 00:08:04.200</b><br>that's it you know<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.200 - 00:08:05.500</b><br>on this next balance<br></p><p><b>00:08:05.500 - 00:08:06.300</b><br>this was not<br></p><p><b>00:08:06.300 - 00:08:08.366</b><br>enough of balance to come back to its base<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.400 - 00:08:09.900</b><br>I stopped trading it<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.966 - 00:08:10.766</b><br>that's it<br></p><p><b>00:08:10.900 - 00:08:14.000</b><br>so you can see here that I got a bounce up to there<br></p><p><b>00:08:14.000 - 00:08:16.400</b><br>and I could have got break even on this trade<br></p><p><b>00:08:16.400 - 00:08:17.466</b><br>because I bought there<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.466 - 00:08:18.133</b><br>there and there<br></p><p><b>00:08:18.133 - 00:08:20.733</b><br>which makes my even probably somewhere in here<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.966 - 00:08:21.900</b><br>I could have got break even<br></p><p><b>00:08:21.900 - 00:08:23.800</b><br>or maybe a little bit of profit over here<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.800 - 00:08:24.933</b><br>I didn't take that<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.466 -

00:09:15.866</b><br>you know I'll make a bit of profit and I'll build<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.200 - 00:09:17.733</b><br>the whole point of these little coins<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.733 - 00:09:18.966</b><br>is to collect coins<br></p><p><b>00:09:18.966 - 00:09:20.300</b><br>I'll make a few coins and be<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.300 - 00:09:21.566</b><br>able to sit on them for free<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.400 - 00:09:25.966</b><br>otherwise this is the one that didn't work out<br></p><p><b>00:09:26.533 - 00:09:29.066</b><br>now ARDR right after it<br></p><p><b>00:09:29.066 - 00:09:31.133</b><br>is almost the identical chart<br></p><p><b>00:09:31.266 - 00:09:33.666</b><br>only it behaved a little bit better<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.933 - 00:09:37.300</b><br>so you can see that I bought bot sold bought bot sold<br></p><p><b>00:09:37.300 - 00:09:38.333</b><br>bought and sold<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.500 - 00:09:39.900</b><br>so everything worked out<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.900 - 00:09:41.866</b><br>but you would also see<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.866 - 00:09:43.300</b><br>if you were drawing your bases<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.300 - 00:09:45.733</b><br>you would see that if you call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.766 - 00:09:47.266</b><br>which it doesn't have a great bounce<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.266 - 00:09:49.200</b><br>but let's just call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.766 - 00:09:52.166</b><br>it didn't quite make it to the base<br></p><p><b>00:09:52.266 - 00:09:55.000</b><br>and then you have to call this a base which it worked<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.000 - 00:09:57.500</b><br>and you have to call that a base<br></p><p><b>00:09:57.500 - 00:09:59.866</b><br>and so everything works out on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:09:59.866 - 00:10:01.666</b><br>except for that one little spot<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.666 - 00:10:03.100</b><br>and you'll see that that's right<br></p><p><b>00:10:03.100 - 00:10:05.733</b><br>after that July where everything was going bad<br></p><p><b>00:10:05.800 - 00:10:08.466</b><br>so I mean I can't totally fault the coin<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.300 - 00:10:11.100</b><br>really this coin does<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.100 - 00:10:13.933</b><br>say that it does respect bases and that it is<br></p><p><b>00:10:14.133 - 00:10:15.333</b><br>playing coin to the rules<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.133 - 00:10:19.000</b><br>so here's arc I don't have any trades on it<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.266 - 00:10:20.133</b><br>lots of these<br></p><p><b>00:10:20.700 -

00:10:28.666</b><br>you just could not go wrong<br></p><p><b>00:10:28.666 - 00:10:29.600</b><br>it doesn't matter how<br></p><p><b>00:10:29.600 - 00:10:32.266</b><br>even if you don't draw your bases perfectly<br></p><p><b>00:10:32.266 - 00:10:33.533</b><br>like look at those bounces<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.533 - 00:10:35.466</b><br>look at that base look at that base<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.066 - 00:10:39.600</b><br>these safe circles are just fantastic to be buying<br></p><p><b>00:10:40.766 -

00:13:22.933</b><br>look at these faces and this massive dip oh<br></p><p><b>00:13:23.100 - 00:13:25.333</b><br>just gorgeous and falls all the way down<br></p><p><b>00:13:25.366 - 00:13:26.700</b><br>and you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:13:26.900 - 00:13:28.700</b><br>so this is a good example of where<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.800 - 00:13:30.800</b><br>you know I bought bought bought<br></p><p><b>00:13:31.000 - 00:13:32.933</b><br>I got all the way down to 31<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.766 -

00:13:41.133</b><br>and I got all the way down to 31s or<br></p><p><b>00:13:41.133 - 00:13:42.600</b><br>3050s or something<br></p><p><b>00:13:42.666 - 00:13:44.566</b><br>and sold up at 40s<br></p><p><b>00:13:44.566 - 00:13:47.466</b><br>so you know I'm expecting a bounce where is my little<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.466 - 00:13:47.800</b><br>thing<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.800 - 00:13:50.266</b><br>so I'm expecting a bounce back to this level right<br></p><p><b>00:13:51.000 - 00:13:54.133</b><br>so I just initially sold a chunk<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.166 - 00:13:55.100</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:13:55.933 - 00:13:56.366</b><br>I<br></p><p><b>00:13:56.366 - 00:13:58.900</b><br>look at that I almost got all the way back up<br></p><p><b>00:13:59.333 - 00:14:01.266</b><br>I guess I didn't catch this one<br></p><p><b>00:14:02.200 - 00:14:04.733</b><br>and then I still held some coins which I<br></p><p><b>00:14:04.800 - 00:14:06.566</b><br>also hold the free coins but from<br></p><p><b>00:14:07.133 - 00:14:13.333</b><br>from 31 to 40 is such big percentages like a 50% gain<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.500 - 00:14:16.000</b><br>and then all the way to 47<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.000 - 00:14:18.266</b><br>and I was like probably at 47 I was like<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.266 - 00:14:19.500</b><br>oh my goodness like<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.900 - 00:14:22.100</b><br>these percentages are so big that<br></p><p><b>00:14:22.333 - 00:14:24.533</b><br>I probably either let it all go or<br></p><p><b>00:14:25.000 - 00:14:26.666</b><br>kept just a little bit of free coins<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.666 - 00:14:27.933</b><br>and let most of it go<br></p><p><b>00:14:29.000 - 00:14:29.800</b><br>core<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.966 - 00:14:33.100</b><br>okay so there's not much to talk about with core<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.100 - 00:14:35.333</b><br>it doesn't it's not breaking bases you know<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.333 - 00:14:36.700</b><br>like it's just<br></p><p><b>00:14:36.700 - 00:14:38.666</b><br>to say going low and then popping up and just<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.666 - 00:14:39.500</b><br>to say going low<br></p><p><b>00:14:39.533 - 00:14:42.366</b><br>so I don't know what the percentages are on that 30 to<br></p><p><b>00:14:42.366 - 00:14:43.800</b><br>34 it's still pretty nice<br></p><p><b>00:14:45.066 - 00:14:46.966</b><br>library coin wow<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.966 - 00:14:47.933</b><br>library coin<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.700 - 00:14:49.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:14:50.400 - 00:14:53.333</b><br>again that is that around the July 1st area<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.333 - 00:14:54.466</b><br>yeah so see<br></p><p><b>00:14:54.466 - 00:14:56.200</b><br>again with that July 1st area<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.200 - 00:14:57.800</b><br>everything kind of wise a tank<br></p><p><b>00:14:57.966 - 00:15:01.133</b><br>so I was able to get in in and in and sell<br></p><p><b>00:15:01.400 - 00:15:03.600</b><br>for a very small profit here<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.133 - 00:15:04.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.900 - 00:15:06.866</b><br>because my average would have been somewhere around<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.866 - 00:15:08.966</b><br>138 or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.100 - 00:15:13.566</b><br>and I sold at 165 you know so for a small profit<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.200 - 00:15:17.200</b><br>and then of course held my free coins like I always do<br></p><p><b>00:15:17.866 - 00:15:18.900</b><br>LMC<br></p><p><b>00:15:19.600 - 00:15:20.866</b><br>wow so<br></p><p><b>00:15:21.933 - 00:15:23.566</b><br>this this back then<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.566 - 00:15:24.533</b><br>it doesn't look like it now<br></p><p><b>00:15:24.533 - 00:15:26.466</b><br>but back then it was an account building<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.733 - 00:15:27.600</b><br>type trade<br></p><p><b>00:15:27.666 - 00:15:29.800</b><br>and so I was making these percentages and<br></p><p><b>00:15:29.800 - 00:15:31.200</b><br>using these spikes<br></p><p><b>00:15:32.366 - 00:15:33.133</b><br>light<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.133 - 00:15:35.666</b><br>coin man I don't know why I don't treat light coin<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.733 - 00:15:39.366</b><br>light coin is just as good as Ethereum and Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:15:39.700 - 00:15:43.566</b><br>everything is always respected very very easy to you<br></p><p><b>00:15:43.566 - 00:15:45.500</b><br>know call bases and make safe<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.500 - 00:15:48.766</b><br>circles and call bases and make safe circles and<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.933 - 00:15:50.766</b><br>call bases and makes it you know<br></p><p><b>00:15:50.766 - 00:15:52.500</b><br>like everything is always respected<br></p><p><b>00:15:52.500 - 00:15:54.500</b><br>so Lightcoin is just another one of those<br></p><p><b>00:15:54.500 - 00:15:56.533</b><br>ones that you could just build an account with<br></p><p><b>00:15:57.333 - 00:16:00.333</b><br>you can always make safe trades PDC<br></p><p><b>00:16:00.566 - 00:16:03.333</b><br>so I only got one trade there so nothing to talk about<br></p><p><b>00:16:03.600 - 00:16:06.133</b><br>PTOY wow this was nuts<br></p><p><b>00:16:06.366 - 00:16:08.966</b><br>so I don't know if you remember PTOY<br></p><p><b>00:16:08.966 - 00:16:11.266</b><br>I mentioned it in one of the blog posts<br></p><p><b>00:16:12.100 - 00:16:17.600</b><br>I caught this spike down to 25 and sold at<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.000 - 00:16:22.133</b><br>54 25 to 54<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.200 - 00:16:25.000</b><br>I mean I've been catching these little tiny moves on it<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.000 - 00:16:25.800</b><br>here and there<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.933 - 00:16:27.900</b><br>but that was just wow<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.266 - 00:16:30.300</b><br>SN GLS<br></p><p><b>00:16:30.300 - 00:16:32.300</b><br>I'm going to speed this up here because I don't want to<br></p><p><b>00:16:32.300 - 00:16:34.166</b><br>I don't want to make this thing take forever<br></p><p><b>00:16:34.333 - 00:16:35.500</b><br>but look at that<br></p><p><b>00:16:35.966 - 00:16:38.366</b><br>by by by sell sell sell so this is just<br></p><p><b>00:16:38.800 - 00:16:41.966</b><br>percentages are not that awesome though from 49<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.500 - 00:16:45.966</b><br>from 5 up to 55 so you know nothing special<br></p><p><b>00:16:46.100 - 00:16:49.933</b><br>I got a random buy and there without any sell<br></p><p><b>00:16:49.933 - 00:16:51.566</b><br>so I probably did sell half position<br></p><p><b>00:16:51.566 - 00:16:52.766</b><br>and just doesn't show<br></p><p><b>00:16:53.266 - 00:16:54.766</b><br>Kanegi does that sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:16:55.266 -

00:17:02.200</b><br>I'm probably sitting on a bunch of free coin from this<br></p><p><b>00:17:02.200 - 00:17:06.133</b><br>but yeah nothing special to talk about start<br></p><p><b>00:17:07.133 - 00:17:07.933</b><br>wow<br></p><p><b>00:17:08.533 -

00:19:34.600</b><br>hide order history<br></p><p><b>00:19:34.966 - 00:19:35.933</b><br>let's get rid of the arrows<br></p><p><b>00:19:35.933 - 00:19:38.666</b><br>so like let's say you called this a base<br></p><p><b>00:19:38.666 - 00:19:39.533</b><br>even this a base<br></p><p><b>00:19:39.533 - 00:19:40.700</b><br>let's say you called this<br></p><p><b>00:19:40.733 - 00:19:42.666</b><br>oh sorry not on a pencil<br></p><p><b>00:19:42.866 - 00:19:44.333</b><br>let's say you called this a base<br></p><p><b>00:19:44.700 - 00:19:45.966</b><br>and you were to get in<br></p><p><b>00:19:46.800 - 00:19:47.333</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:19:47.333 - 00:19:50.666</b><br>right here as your initial entry which is very early<br></p><p><b>00:19:50.666 - 00:19:52.666</b><br>you know like that's not much percentage<br></p><p><b>00:19:52.700 - 00:19:54.366</b><br>but let's say you bought in right there<br></p><p><b>00:19:54.700 - 00:19:55.700</b><br>then I would be<br></p><p><b>00:19:55.700 - 00:19:57.266</b><br>you you have to you have to<br></p><p><b>00:19:57.266 - 00:19:59.333</b><br>respect the fact that the base is so close<br></p><p><b>00:19:59.333 - 00:20:01.133</b><br>so you have to be ready for a quick<br></p><p><b>00:20:01.766 - 00:20:03.800</b><br>for a very very quick sell<br></p><p><b>00:20:03.900 - 00:20:06.400</b><br>and a very small percentage trade you know<br></p><p><b>00:20:06.400 - 00:20:07.933</b><br>you got to think about it so that's why<br></p><p><b>00:20:08.100 - 00:20:10.366</b><br>you know that's not really the best place but<br></p><p><b>00:20:11.500 - 00:20:13.066</b><br>all the way down here<br></p><p><b>00:20:13.133 - 00:20:14.566</b><br>anywhere in here<br></p><p><b>00:20:14.966 - 00:20:18.066</b><br>would be fantastic by off of this base<br></p><p><b>00:20:18.300 - 00:20:19.933</b><br>because I don't qualify<br></p><p><b>00:20:19.966 - 00:20:21.166</b><br>this as a base<br></p><p><b>00:20:21.166 - 00:20:23.333</b><br>you know like that's not much of a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:20:23.333 - 00:20:26.200</b><br>so we're still working you can get rid of that<br></p><p><b>00:20:27.300 - 00:20:30.533</b><br>and we are still working off of this as your main base<br></p><p><b>00:20:30.533 - 00:20:32.966</b><br>which you can see that it comes back up to test it<br></p><p><b>00:20:32.966 - 00:20:33.766</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:20:34.466 - 00:20:35.133</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:20:35.133 - 00:20:37.266</b><br>all of this is your safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:20:37.733 - 00:20:39.000</b><br>even if you get in<br></p><p><b>00:20:39.000 - 00:20:41.733</b><br>so let's say your first initial entry was right<br></p><p><b>00:20:41.733 - 00:20:42.533</b><br>here<br></p><p><b>00:20:42.966 - 00:20:45.566</b><br>then I would take a cell on this because you<br></p><p><b>00:20:45.566 - 00:20:47.500</b><br>you really didn't give it much space so<br></p><p><b>00:20:47.566 - 00:20:49.733</b><br>anywhere that you make your first initial by<br></p><p><b>00:20:50.466 - 00:20:52.400</b><br>any quick spike is called a gift<br></p><p><b>00:20:52.400 - 00:20:54.866</b><br>that's all I would do is take that gift and<br></p><p><b>00:20:54.866 - 00:20:57.566</b><br>buy it and still be working off of this face<br></p><p><b>00:20:57.933 - 00:20:58.733</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:20:59.000 - 00:20:59.900</b><br>you know obviously<br></p><p><b>00:20:59.900 - 00:21:01.166</b><br>everything you would have bought down here would<br></p><p><b>00:21:01.166 - 00:21:01.866</b><br>worked out<br></p><p><b>00:21:01.866 - 00:21:02.566</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:21:02.566 - 00:21:04.166</b><br>I just wanted to bring that up that<br></p><p><b>00:21:04.166 - 00:21:05.733</b><br>if you if you nibble<br></p><p><b>00:21:05.966 - 00:21:06.766</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:21:07.133 - 00:21:07.800</b><br>if you take a<br></p><p><b>00:21:07.800 - 00:21:10.700</b><br>trade near the bottom of the base like right after it<br></p><p><b>00:21:10.700 - 00:21:13.133</b><br>cracks you see that initial panic and you go ahead and<br></p><p><b>00:21:13.133 - 00:21:15.366</b><br>you just so excited and you have to get in<br></p><p><b>00:21:15.700 - 00:21:18.666</b><br>then because you didn't give it much of a move<br></p><p><b>00:21:18.866 - 00:21:21.100</b><br>you have to expect to have to sell it right away<br></p><p><b>00:21:21.100 - 00:21:23.133</b><br>you got to react fast if you're going to do that<br></p><p><b>00:21:23.266 - 00:21:25.000</b><br>otherwise wait for it to play out<br></p><p><b>00:21:25.333 - 00:21:27.800</b><br>like let the whole panic happen<br></p><p><b>00:21:28.300 - 00:21:29.300</b><br>then start you know<br></p><p><b>00:21:29.300 - 00:21:30.533</b><br>once you start seeing redbar<br></p><p><b>00:21:30.533 -

00:21:38.900</b><br>and you get all these redbars now you're really<br></p><p><b>00:21:39.266 - 00:21:41.266</b><br>time to start loading in and getting in<br></p><p><b>00:21:41.333 - 00:21:42.133</b><br>heavy and<br></p><p><b>00:21:42.500 - 00:21:43.800</b><br>anyway okay sorry I'm gonna<br></p><p><b>00:21:43.900 - 00:21:46.466</b><br>if I don't stop talking I'm just gonna keep going so<br></p><p><b>00:21:47.000 - 00:21:49.400</b><br>I'm gonna go back to trading and thanks for watching<br></p></body></html>
