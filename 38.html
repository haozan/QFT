00:00:06.266</b><br>so I thought I'd make a quick<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.266 - 00:00:07.333</b><br>video for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.800 - 00:00:09.500</b><br>just talking with markets because<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.733 - 00:00:11.933</b><br>I'm getting tons of messages from everybody<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.300 - 00:00:13.733</b><br>because people are getting frustrated<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.366 - 00:00:15.800</b><br>what a crazy trading day today<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.800 - 00:00:17.666</b><br>oh man I just<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.666 - 00:00:18.800</b><br>I made a killing today<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.566 - 00:00:20.400</b><br>okay anyway<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.066 - 00:00:21.266</b><br>yeah<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.266 - 00:00:23.166</b><br>people are getting frustrated because of this action<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.400 - 00:00:23.766</b><br>now<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.766 - 00:00:26.733</b><br>take a look at Bitcoin and you'll see that you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.100 - 00:00:30.166</b><br>it's really easy like super duper easy<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.166 - 00:00:32.066</b><br>right to draw basis<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.966 - 00:00:34.400</b><br>when you get these huge<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.533 - 00:00:38.300</b><br>dives you know in bases when you get these huge dives<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.300 - 00:00:39.100</b><br>those are really<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.100 - 00:00:42.866</b><br>easy to read and you get huge percentages<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.333 - 00:00:48.166</b><br>but right now bitcoin is grinding and it's doing 10<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.166 - 00:00:50.133</b><br>like it's doing one thousand dollar dives<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.266 - 00:00:52.933</b><br>so you know you'll draw yourself a base like this<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.166 - 00:00:55.166</b><br>and you know that's pretty strong<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.166 - 00:00:57.466</b><br>that's from 9,000 to almost 12 thousand<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.466 - 00:00:58.400</b><br>so that's not bad<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.066 - 00:01:01.100</b><br>and then what do you get this<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.733 - 00:01:03.966</b><br>little itty bitty little safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.533 - 00:01:06.133</b><br>you know you're expecting like<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.166 - 00:01:08.466</b><br>you're expecting a circle like these ones<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.600 - 00:01:09.866</b><br>and you're getting just this little<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.866 - 00:01:12.100</b><br>tiny itty bead little thing and then it bounce up<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.133 - 00:01:15.333</b><br>and then what are you gonna draw a new base here<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.333 - 00:01:17.200</b><br>is that does that qualify as a base<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.200 - 00:01:18.366</b><br>if you're thinking like<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.800 - 00:01:21.700</b><br>you know 8,500 to 9,500<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.766 - 00:01:23.266</b><br>so a thousand dollar swings that<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.266 - 00:01:25.266</b><br>does that qualify as a base<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.800 - 00:01:26.600</b><br>uh huh<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.700 - 00:01:27.866</b><br>you know not really<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.100 - 00:01:29.566</b><br>so then what are you still working off of<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.566 - 00:01:30.866</b><br>this base over here<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.333 - 00:01:34.400</b><br>and then it dips you know so it's frustrating everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.400 - 00:01:36.700</b><br>everybody's maybe calling this a base now<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.700 - 00:01:38.400</b><br>and then it dips and gives you a<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.800 - 00:01:39.900</b><br>little circle again<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.066 - 00:01:40.866</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.066 - 00:01:43.133</b><br>and then of course it bounces like it always does<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.133 - 00:01:45.533</b><br>it respects its base it does its little bounce<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.566 - 00:01:47.366</b><br>and then what are you now going to call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.366 - 00:01:48.766</b><br>is 74 now your base<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.766 - 00:01:51.966</b><br>you know that was from 74 all the way up to 91<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.700 - 00:01:54.366</b><br>so that's a little bit better<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.966 - 00:01:56.100</b><br>but then what happens<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.100 - 00:01:58.800</b><br>then you get this little tiny crack<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.900 - 00:02:00.600</b><br>and it bounce right back<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.700 - 00:02:01.766</b><br>and you know like<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.866 - 00:02:02.866</b><br>how are you supposed to trade that<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.866 - 00:02:04.566</b><br>I'm not even trading this stuff<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.200 - 00:02:07.500</b><br>I'm not even bothering with it<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.600 - 00:02:08.500</b><br>because those<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.500 - 00:02:11.366</b><br>percentages are just too small for me to even consider<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.700 - 00:02:14.566</b><br>you know $1,000 up and down $1,000 up and down<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.600 - 00:02:15.933</b><br>what am I gonna nibble here<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.066 - 00:02:17.200</b><br>that would be just a nibble<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.200 - 00:02:19.266</b><br>and then I'd be taking quick profits<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.700 - 00:02:20.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.000 - 00:02:22.500</b><br>and I'm hearing everybody's frustration<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.500 - 00:02:24.100</b><br>because they're calling these bases<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.100 - 00:02:26.500</b><br>there's a lot in our community<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.600 - 00:02:29.000</b><br>that are saying well I'm working off of the<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.200 - 00:02:31.566</b><br>you know the 83 base<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.600 - 00:02:32.600</b><br>and but<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.600 - 00:02:34.133</b><br>they're calling a base without really<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.133 - 00:02:35.566</b><br>very much of a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.566 - 00:02:37.466</b><br>to qualify that base<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.866 - 00:02:41.800</b><br>so you know the real base was up here at maybe 91 92<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.800 - 00:02:43.500</b><br>and then the obvious base<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.500 - 00:02:45.333</b><br>obvious obvious 6,000<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.800 - 00:02:47.500</b><br>you know as obvious as day<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.800 - 00:02:49.100</b><br>so that's what I'm waiting for<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.100 - 00:02:52.766</b><br>I'm waiting for this to happen or this to happen<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.166 - 00:02:54.866</b><br>you know I'm waiting for that<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.866 - 00:03:00.766</b><br>that drop below 6,000 to 4,000 or 3,500 but<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.966 - 00:03:02.800</b><br>you know how much patience that takes<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.800 - 00:03:04.400</b><br>you know this that might not happen<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.600 - 00:03:06.900</b><br>this thing might start to work its way all the way back<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.900 - 00:03:08.100</b><br>up to 20 thousand<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.100 - 00:03:10.333</b><br>go up and we're back in a bowl<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.533 - 00:03:12.366</b><br>period so<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.166 - 00:03:14.566</b><br>you know what's going to happen here<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.800 - 00:03:16.066</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.066 - 00:03:18.933</b><br>so let's just take a second and go over the rules<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.966 - 00:03:19.933</b><br>again for a minute<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.666 - 00:03:22.066</b><br>because when I'm explaining my<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.266 - 00:03:22.366</b><br>what<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.366 - 00:03:24.366</b><br>I'm trying to get you guys to think the way I think<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.533 - 00:03:26.400</b><br>when I'm explaining my method<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.866 - 00:03:28.133</b><br>I want you to understand<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.200 - 00:03:30.300</b><br>why it is we take the trade right<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.300 - 00:03:31.800</b><br>we need the panic<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.366 - 00:03:33.933</b><br>we have to have the panic<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.100 - 00:03:35.000</b><br>if you don't have the panic<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.000 - 00:03:37.000</b><br>the safe circle is not a safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.366 - 00:03:40.666</b><br>so it's important to look at this and think about<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.666 - 00:03:41.600</b><br>what it is so<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.600 - 00:03:42.500</b><br>here let's just<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.500 - 00:03:44.700</b><br>delete everything that we got on the screen here<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.466 - 00:03:46.266</b><br>right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.500 - 00:03:50.733</b><br>so this is a clear base you know this<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.533 - 00:03:52.600</b><br>should have made a circle<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.266 - 00:03:55.066</b><br>do that again<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.533 - 00:03:58.166</b><br>this right here is a clear base right so 90<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.200 - 00:04:00.166</b><br>whatever let's call it 9200<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.300 - 00:04:01.600</b><br>is a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.166 - 00:04:03.933</b><br>but you need a panic<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.400 - 00:04:06.133</b><br>for you to be able to<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.133 - 00:04:07.366</b><br>so you can go ahead and draw your<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.366 - 00:04:08.466</b><br>save circle if you want<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.566 - 00:04:09.900</b><br>you can say okay here<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.900 - 00:04:11.000</b><br>was a base<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.266 - 00:04:14.000</b><br>and here's the amount that it fell<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.366 - 00:04:17.700</b><br>so there was your save circle and here was a base<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.066 - 00:04:19.733</b><br>and here's the amount that it fells<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.733 - 00:04:21.166</b><br>so there's your safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.333 - 00:04:24.566</b><br>so you can easily draw a circle right here right so<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.700 - 00:04:26.333</b><br>if you were to back up in time<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.933 - 00:04:29.766</b><br>can I do that yet<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.766 - 00:04:31.366</b><br>so if you were to back up in time<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.333 - 00:04:33.333</b><br>you know at this point<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.333 - 00:04:35.133</b><br>you could go ahead and draw your base and draw your C<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.133 - 00:04:37.466</b><br>circle but then what are you expecting<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.466 - 00:04:39.100</b><br>you're expecting this panic<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.166 - 00:04:40.300</b><br>right you're expecting<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.466 - 00:04:41.966</b><br>you're expecting to nibble<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.066 - 00:04:44.066</b><br>somewhere in the middle of this safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.066 - 00:04:47.866</b><br>and then you start to take size down here under 7000<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.866 - 00:04:49.200</b><br>maybe 6500<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.200 - 00:04:51.733</b><br>get real big size because you know you're near the end<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.933 - 00:04:53.266</b><br>of a real panic<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.700 - 00:04:55.400</b><br>but you're not getting a panic<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.533 - 00:04:56.133</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.133 - 00:04:56.966</b><br>you're getting that<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.966 - 00:04:59.866</b><br>little quick panic that doesn't really materialize<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.866 - 00:05:01.100</b><br>and then it turns right back up<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.566 - 00:05:03.466</b><br>and then you're getting another little quick panic<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.466 - 00:05:06.266</b><br>and you know like so you're getting a grind<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.266 - 00:05:09.500</b><br>that's what this is a grind that's not<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.100 - 00:05:14.800</b><br>going to qualify for you to buy it and be safe<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.966 - 00:05:17.966</b><br>yes bitcoin is very forgiving<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.100 - 00:05:20.500</b><br>bitcoin does respect its bases<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.500 - 00:05:22.166</b><br>so all of these little<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.166 - 00:05:23.733</b><br>tiny beginnings of panics<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.733 - 00:05:25.700</b><br>end up bouncing right back to<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.800 - 00:05:27.600</b><br>respect their base or even<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.000 - 00:05:29.300</b><br>go above their base<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.300 - 00:05:31.900</b><br>and then you get this little panic and it<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.066 - 00:05:33.400</b><br>and it respects it again<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.600 - 00:05:36.966</b><br>but because their buyers and sellers are very heavy<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.966 - 00:05:38.566</b><br>especially down here<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.666 - 00:05:39.766</b><br>lots of people think hey<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.766 - 00:05:41.466</b><br>we're getting close to a bottom<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.866 - 00:05:43.500</b><br>and you know maybe we are<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.500 - 00:05:44.200</b><br>I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.200 -

00:08:41.500</b><br>the whole point<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.500 - 00:08:44.333</b><br>is that you crack this base and you get a panic<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.466 - 00:08:45.733</b><br>well you didn't get that<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.133 -
