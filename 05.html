00:01:30.933</b><br>I own EOS and I'm thinking about getting rid of<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.800 - 00:01:33.766</b><br>my shares because it's just been going down for days<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.766 - 00:01:35.133</b><br>and there hasn't been a big bounce<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.500 - 00:01:36.733</b><br>and okay<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.733 - 00:01:40.366</b><br>so that question is not really related to what I do<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.366 - 00:01:41.166</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.700 - 00:01:44.900</b><br>you know obviously you're asking for a question on<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.066 - 00:01:47.533</b><br>so I got something in my eye<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.400 - 00:01:49.300</b><br>on investment<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.566 - 00:01:51.500</b><br>and I'm a trader okay<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.500 - 00:01:53.533</b><br>yes I will invest in EOS of course<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.533 - 00:01:55.100</b><br>when it comes down to reality<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.500 - 00:01:56.933</b><br>it's a little high right now for me<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.333 - 00:01:58.133</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.700 - 00:01:59.900</b><br>and I did buy<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.900 - 00:02:00.733</b><br>I don't know if you remember<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.733 - 00:02:02.066</b><br>I bought right here on this little<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.066 - 00:02:03.000</b><br>dip right there<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.200 - 00:02:04.666</b><br>and then I sold into this<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.366 - 00:02:07.733</b><br>but this person was saying<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.166 - 00:02:09.400</b><br>there hasn't been a major bounce<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.400 - 00:02:11.100</b><br>and it's been going down for days<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.166 - 00:02:12.400</b><br>look at this chart<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.533 - 00:02:15.200</b><br>this you could not ask for a nicer chart to trade<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.200 - 00:02:17.266</b><br>look at how beautiful this chart is<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.466 - 00:02:20.000</b><br>so let's just look at it really quickly together<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.133 - 00:02:23.200</b><br>so if I blow this up just a touch<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.800 - 00:02:25.466</b><br>me allow myself to move<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.733 - 00:02:30.400</b><br>look at this all the way up to 23 24<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.400 - 00:02:33.166</b><br>and then all the way down to 10<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.166 - 00:02:34.133</b><br>well really 11<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.766 - 00:02:36.566</b><br>so you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.133 - 00:02:38.500</b><br>that's like double your money<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.933 - 00:02:40.333</b><br>it's more than double your money<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.400 - 00:02:41.166</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.166 - 00:02:43.066</b><br>you know it hit 10 or 11<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.166 - 00:02:46.300</b><br>hit 11 1 2 three times right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.866 - 00:02:48.966</b><br>and off each time it hit 11<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.966 - 00:02:51.733</b><br>it bounced all the way back up to 20<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.900 - 00:02:53.800</b><br>and all the way back down to like<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.966 - 00:02:56.666</b><br>10 and then all the way back up to<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.366 - 00:02:58.166</b><br></p><p><b>00:02:58.400 - 00:03:00.666</b><br>and then all the way back down to<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.066 - 00:03:02.500</b><br>11 and then all the way<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.500 - 00:03:04.666</b><br>back up to 20 I mean<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.666 - 00:03:06.500</b><br>wow you know so<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.933 - 00:03:11.133</b><br>I don't know if you're investing and you're just<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.133 - 00:03:12.466</b><br>watching all of this happen<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.866 - 00:03:15.266</b><br>and you're just sitting there watching it happen<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.066 - 00:03:16.866</b><br>ah<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.866 - 00:03:18.566</b><br>you could be in for free right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.566 - 00:03:20.266</b><br>you wouldn't even be investing<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.400 - 00:03:23.000</b><br>like these are double your money moves<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.066 - 00:03:23.866</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.600 - 00:03:27.166</b><br>okay let's take our little thing and call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.166 - 00:03:31.066</b><br>obviously it touched three times it hit and and what<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.733 - 00:03:33.466</b><br>what makes it a base<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.800 - 00:03:36.666</b><br>it makes it a base when the buyers<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.700 - 00:03:39.000</b><br>have a huge reaction<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.466 - 00:03:41.600</b><br>from it touching it<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.900 - 00:03:45.066</b><br>a huge reaction that means this is a strong base<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.066 - 00:03:47.800</b><br>that means that when it cracks this base over here<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.300 - 00:03:51.866</b><br>well that's a really great spot to buy<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.866 - 00:03:53.566</b><br>and then you get it a jump<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.566 - 00:03:55.200</b><br>and over here you get a jump from 8<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.566 - 00:03:57.600</b><br>to 13 so<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.566 - 00:04:00.566</b><br>you know that's like 35 percent<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.800 - 00:04:03.466</b><br>these are that's a really nice little little move<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.500 - 00:04:05.300</b><br>and then here's your new base right<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.300 - 00:04:06.933</b><br>that's your new base now around 8<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.000 - 00:04:08.933</b><br>and here it cracks just<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.533 - 00:04:12.466</b><br>it's fighting to try to crack it but it has a hard time<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.466 - 00:04:14.500</b><br>it does crack it I wouldn't have caught that<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.900 - 00:04:16.566</b><br>there's no way I would have bought the 7s<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.000 - 00:04:18.400</b><br>because I don't generally buy like<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.400 - 00:04:20.366</b><br>right here underneath the base<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.366 - 00:04:21.066</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.066 - 00:04:24.133</b><br>I mean if you did catch it all the way back up to<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.200 - 00:04:27.866</b><br>13 again from 7 so there's 45 percent<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.766 - 00:04:30.066</b><br>so like I mean<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.066 - 00:04:33.200</b><br>I don't know if you're just investing<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.666 - 00:04:35.100</b><br>look at look that's like<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.100 - 00:04:37.133</b><br>there's probably three or four opportunities here<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.133 - 00:04:39.700</b><br>you had to be in it for free<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.000 - 00:04:41.333</b><br>to own it for free<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.333 - 00:04:44.000</b><br>if you were planning to put $1,000 into this<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.200 - 00:04:45.000</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.900 - 00:04:49.200</b><br>a bounce off of this 10 all the way up to 20<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.566 - 00:04:51.366</b><br>would give you $2,000<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.366 - 00:04:52.733</b><br>and you could take your thousand dollars back<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.733 - 00:04:53.700</b><br>and put in your pocket<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.200 - 00:04:56.333</b><br>but even if you were just called this base<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.333 - 00:04:57.766</b><br>and you decide to buy right here<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.000 - 00:05:00.800</b><br>35% that's $350<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.133 - 00:05:02.900</b><br>you can put the rest back in your pocket if you want<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.900 - 00:05:04.766</b><br>or you can invest your thousand dollars again<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.766 - 00:05:05.733</b><br>right here and make<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.066 - 00:05:06.666</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.666 - 00:05:11.533</b><br>I don't know $400 $300 now you're in $600 for free<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.100 - 00:05:13.766</b><br>and you can put the rest back in your pocket<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.766 - 00:05:16.966</b><br>or you can just keep your initial investment of $1,000<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.100 - 00:05:19.966</b><br>and put the rest back in your pocket which is 700<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.966 - 00:05:21.533</b><br>you can stick back in your pocket<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.533 - 00:05:23.066</b><br>and you only really<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.200 - 00:05:25.800</b><br>ever put at risk 300 of your own money<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.700 - 00:05:27.200</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.200 - 00:05:28.600</b><br>but if you're just sitting there<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.200 - 00:05:30.766</b><br>and you're watching all of this happen<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.766 -

00:05:41.066</b><br>because did you get in over here<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.066 - 00:05:43.166</b><br>because if you got in over here and now we're<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.333 - 00:05:44.933</b><br>well we're almost even to that<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.300 -

00:15:23.333</b><br>and that math said that this number<br></p><p><b>00:15:24.066 - 00:15:24.866</b><br>should be<br></p><p><b>00:15:24.966 - 00:15:27.166</b><br>point zero zero to eight<br></p><p><b>00:15:29.000 - 00:15:30.533</b><br>so we're at point<br></p><p><b>00:15:30.766 - 00:15:33.566</b><br>04 right now I was buying it at point<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.766 - 00:15:36.933</b><br>047 and I just bought some<br></p><p><b>00:15:37.333 -

00:15:55.300</b><br>so I was like I gotta get out of this thing<br></p><p><b>00:15:55.300 - 00:15:56.866</b><br>this thing's gonna fall to the ground<br></p><p><b>00:15:58.166 - 00:16:01.966</b><br>so if you can if I can zoom in a little bit to show you<br></p><p><b>00:16:03.000 - 00:16:06.200</b><br>let me zoom in and zoom in and zoom in so I bought<br></p><p><b>00:16:06.333 - 00:16:09.200</b><br>in that big volume volume bar right here<br></p><p><b>00:16:10.533 - 00:16:13.900</b><br>or maybe this one I don't know I got it 47<br></p><p><b>00:16:15.133 -

00:19:08.000</b><br>without looking at the charts let's just talk about<br></p><p><b>00:19:08.400 - 00:19:10.900</b><br>the process of how people trade<br></p><p><b>00:19:11.133 - 00:19:11.933</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:19:12.966 -

00:22:37.000</b><br>you<br></p><p><b>00:22:37.166 - 00:22:39.200</b><br>want the thing to fall as far as it's going to fall<br></p><p><b>00:22:39.200 - 00:22:40.966</b><br>and then you want to buy at the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:22:40.966 -

00:25:27.766</b><br>let me just put this<br></p><p><b>00:25:28.066 - 00:25:29.966</b><br>so the other side of that coin is is<br></p><p><b>00:25:30.966 - 00:25:33.333</b><br>a big guy that's trying to sell a large amount<br></p><p><b>00:25:33.333 - 00:25:33.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:25:33.500 - 00:25:35.533</b><br>there'll be some guys that are sitting at the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:25:36.066 - 00:25:37.600</b><br>ready to buy a large amount<br></p><p><b>00:25:37.700 -

00:25:49.366</b><br>amount that's what happened to me in the Pacoin<br></p><p><b>00:25:49.366 - 00:25:50.566</b><br>of course the Pacoin<br></p><p><b>00:25:51.166 - 00:25:54.466</b><br>doesn't have as many players as this so one big guy<br></p><p><b>00:25:54.533 - 00:25:55.666</b><br>who just dropped<br></p><p><b>00:25:55.666 - 00:25:55.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:25:55.900 - 00:25:58.600</b><br>the price just dropped from 26 all the way down to 4<br></p><p><b>00:25:58.866 - 00:26:00.333</b><br>and then he's just sitting there<br></p><p><b>00:26:00.333 - 00:26:01.933</b><br>with an order on the ask<br></p><p><b>00:26:02.000 - 00:26:05.733</b><br>for 8,000 coins to try to sell off 8,000 coins at 4<br></p><p><b>00:26:06.000 - 00:26:08.533</b><br>and you know then all of a sudden you can<br></p><p><b>00:26:08.533 - 00:26:11.333</b><br>you can say to yourself well in my case I was like hey<br></p><p><b>00:26:11.500 - 00:26:14.100</b><br>there's the one guy who's holding this market down<br></p><p><b>00:26:14.866 - 00:26:16.133</b><br>maybe there isn't bad news<br></p><p><b>00:26:16.133 - 00:26:18.733</b><br>maybe just one guy is just trying to unload<br></p><p><b>00:26:19.566 - 00:26:20.866</b><br>but in this case of course<br></p><p><b>00:26:20.866 - 00:26:22.000</b><br>in that case there was bad news<br></p><p><b>00:26:22.000 - 00:26:22.566</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:26:22.566 - 00:26:24.800</b><br>anyway what I'm trying to say to you guys is that<br></p><p><b>00:26:25.000 - 00:26:27.400</b><br>it is very difficult to<br></p><p><b>00:26:28.733 - 00:26:31.600</b><br>like volume is one of those things that you can use<br></p><p><b>00:26:32.133 - 00:26:34.200</b><br>to your advantage because if you see those block trades<br></p><p><b>00:26:34.200 - 00:26:35.866</b><br>then you know somebody big is<br></p><p><b>00:26:36.100 - 00:26:38.066</b><br>really supporting that price<br></p><p><b>00:26:38.333 - 00:26:40.066</b><br>but to use it just<br></p><p><b>00:26:40.266 - 00:26:42.066</b><br>you know to plan all your trades around that<br></p><p><b>00:26:42.066 - 00:26:43.666</b><br>it's going to be very difficult to do<br></p><p><b>00:26:43.733 - 00:26:45.900</b><br>it's really an in the moment type of thing<br></p><p><b>00:26:46.366 - 00:26:47.500</b><br>it's much much<br></p><p><b>00:26:47.500 - 00:26:49.866</b><br>easier to trade the way that I explain to you guys<br></p><p><b>00:26:49.866 - 00:26:50.766</b><br>where you just<br></p><p><b>00:26:51.266 - 00:26:54.400</b><br>you know draw your base right here<br></p><p><b>00:26:54.766 - 00:26:57.500</b><br>and you're going to buy anything under here<br></p><p><b>00:26:57.733 - 00:26:59.533</b><br>and you might start buying<br></p><p><b>00:26:59.766 - 00:27:01.533</b><br>here and here<br></p><p><b>00:27:01.600 - 00:27:02.333</b><br>and here<br></p><p><b>00:27:02.333 - 00:27:04.100</b><br>and not having anything to do with block trades<br></p><p><b>00:27:04.100 - 00:27:06.100</b><br>just because you can predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:27:06.100 - 00:27:08.066</b><br>and you don't know how low it's going to drop before<br></p><p><b>00:27:08.300 - 00:27:10.300</b><br>it finally turns around but you're<br></p><p><b>00:27:10.300 - 00:27:11.466</b><br>buying in this<br></p><p><b>00:27:11.533 - 00:27:14.900</b><br>circle of safety let's call it a circle of safety<br></p><p><b>00:27:15.566 - 00:27:15.966</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:27:15.966 - 00:27:18.400</b><br>you're below the base and you know you're going to get<br></p><p><b>00:27:18.566 - 00:27:21.400</b><br>bounce right back up and all of this is safe<br></p><p><b>00:27:21.400 - 00:27:23.366</b><br>you can just buy anywhere in this circle<br></p><p><b>00:27:23.400 - 00:27:25.366</b><br>and then you can go ahead and draw your line<br></p><p><b>00:27:25.866 - 00:27:28.666</b><br>and then when you get another nice reaction bounce up<br></p><p><b>00:27:28.666 - 00:27:31.300</b><br>you can go ahead and draw your line and when you<br></p><p><b>00:27:31.466 - 00:27:32.700</b><br>well you don't see very many here<br></p><p><b>00:27:32.700 - 00:27:34.100</b><br>but sorry just a second<br></p><p><b>00:27:34.100 - 00:27:35.933</b><br>we move this over because my camera is in the way<br></p><p><b>00:27:36.933 - 00:27:37.733</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:27:39.866 - 00:27:43.333</b><br>back to this so you get another nice balance up<br></p><p><b>00:27:43.333 - 00:27:44.966</b><br>there's another safety line<br></p><p><b>00:27:44.966 - 00:27:47.266</b><br>and this is your circle that you can buy<br></p><p><b>00:27:47.300 - 00:27:50.066</b><br>and you get your nice balance up and there you are<br></p><p><b>00:27:50.066 - 00:27:51.000</b><br>you're good to go<br></p><p><b>00:27:51.733 - 00:27:53.533</b><br>let me just move this out again<br></p><p><b>00:27:54.966 - 00:27:57.566</b><br>zoom and then over here<br></p><p><b>00:28:01.300 - 00:28:03.800</b><br>yes I don't know what I'm doing anymore okay<br></p><p><b>00:28:05.366 - 00:28:07.566</b><br>yeah so you had a nice bounce there<br></p><p><b>00:28:07.566 - 00:28:08.766</b><br>there's your base<br></p><p><b>00:28:09.000 - 00:28:12.100</b><br>and then in this whole mess like this<br></p><p><b>00:28:12.100 - 00:28:14.000</b><br>I wouldn't call really very much of a balance<br></p><p><b>00:28:14.000 - 00:28:15.933</b><br>and I wouldn't call this very much of a balance<br></p><p><b>00:28:16.266 - 00:28:20.966</b><br>so really you're safe to buy and buy and buy<br></p><p><b>00:28:21.066 - 00:28:22.533</b><br>and buy all you want<br></p><p><b>00:28:22.533 - 00:28:24.333</b><br>and then you get your nice big<br></p><p><b>00:28:24.533 - 00:28:26.800</b><br>bounce all the way back up to your base<br></p><p><b>00:28:26.933 - 00:28:27.666</b><br>and now<br></p><p><b>00:28:27.666 - 00:28:29.566</b><br>here's your base and you're not gonna get another try<br></p><p><b>00:28:29.566 - 00:28:31.866</b><br>but now you can draw this base in because<br></p><p><b>00:28:31.866 - 00:28:33.366</b><br>that was a great big bounce<br></p><p><b>00:28:33.366 - 00:28:34.933</b><br>and you can draw this base in<br></p><p><b>00:28:34.933 - 00:28:37.100</b><br>because that was a pretty good sized bounce<br></p><p><b>00:28:37.166 - 00:28:39.000</b><br>and then you're clear to buy this<br></p><p><b>00:28:39.200 - 00:28:40.000</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:28:41.266 - 00:28:42.100</b><br>of this one<br></p><p><b>00:28:42.100 - 00:28:45.066</b><br>right because that's your base draw it across<br></p><p><b>00:28:45.333 - 00:28:46.600</b><br>clear to by this section<br></p><p><b>00:28:47.100 - 00:28:49.500</b><br>and then look at the massive bounce you get off of this<br></p><p><b>00:28:49.500 - 00:28:52.166</b><br>so this has now become a very clear base<br></p><p><b>00:28:52.366 - 00:28:54.500</b><br>and you got a pretty good bounce off of that<br></p><p><b>00:28:54.500 - 00:28:56.100</b><br>so I would call that a base<br></p><p><b>00:28:56.600 - 00:28:59.100</b><br>and I can't see again because my camera's in the way<br></p><p><b>00:29:00.066 - 00:29:03.533</b><br>but yeah so if you did buy in here<br></p><p><b>00:29:05.800 - 00:29:06.900</b><br>you'd be okay<br></p><p><b>00:29:07.000 - 00:29:09.200</b><br>and so forth and so forth and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:29:14.133 - 00:29:15.733</b><br>so anyway I'm gonna leave it like that<br></p><p><b>00:29:15.866 - 00:29:18.166</b><br>I could just continue to discuss volume with you guys<br></p><p><b>00:29:18.166 - 00:29:20.466</b><br>it's we're at 30 minutes I'm gonna stop the video now<br></p><p><b>00:29:21.533 - 00:29:23.600</b><br>I could make a video just on volume<br></p><p><b>00:29:23.600 - 00:29:27.900</b><br>and get a little more in depth but the reality is that<br></p><p><b>00:29:29.600 - 00:29:32.300</b><br>really this is the easier way to trade<br></p><p><b>00:29:32.366 - 00:29:34.766</b><br>and especially when you're new if<br></p><p><b>00:29:34.766 - 00:29:36.900</b><br>you might misread the volume<br></p><p><b>00:29:37.300 - 00:29:39.166</b><br>you know I've been trading for a long time<br></p><p><b>00:29:39.166 - 00:29:40.566</b><br>so in the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:29:40.700 - 00:29:43.066</b><br>you know there's so many tricks that<br></p><p><b>00:29:43.400 - 00:29:45.400</b><br>you really have to watch all those little things<br></p><p><b>00:29:45.400 - 00:29:47.200</b><br>just to get a little more information<br></p><p><b>00:29:47.366 - 00:29:49.166</b><br>and I see those block trades and I'm like oh<br></p><p><b>00:29:49.166 - 00:29:50.900</b><br>I want to really get in with this big guy<br></p><p><b>00:29:51.333 - 00:29:51.733</b><br>that was a<br></p><p><b>00:29:51.733 - 00:29:53.966</b><br>ridiculous amount that he just bought or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:29:53.966 - 00:29:56.000</b><br>obviously they're supporting the price at this level<br></p><p><b>00:29:56.966 - 00:29:59.466</b><br>and that's okay you can do that but<br></p><p><b>00:30:00.600 - 00:30:03.666</b><br>you can't count it on every time because sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:30:04.000 - 00:30:05.766</b><br>you know what will happen is<br></p><p><b>00:30:05.966 - 00:30:07.066</b><br>people will panic and it will<br></p><p><b>00:30:07.066 - 00:30:09.300</b><br>fall and fall and fall and fall and fall<br></p><p><b>00:30:09.300 - 00:30:10.100</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:30:10.100 - 00:30:11.133</b><br>it will just start<br></p><p><b>00:30:11.333 - 00:30:12.100</b><br>staying at the same<br></p><p><b>00:30:12.100 - 00:30:14.000</b><br>price a little bit with a few extra buys<br></p><p><b>00:30:14.000 - 00:30:14.766</b><br>and then before you know it<br></p><p><b>00:30:14.766 - 00:30:17.566</b><br>a few people start thinking that's the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:30:17.933 - 00:30:18.800</b><br>and then a few more<br></p><p><b>00:30:18.800 - 00:30:20.100</b><br>people start thinking that's the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:30:20.100 - 00:30:21.933</b><br>and some people stop wanting to sell and<br></p><p><b>00:30:21.933 - 00:30:23.400</b><br>the thing just turns<br></p><p><b>00:30:23.500 - 00:30:24.966</b><br>and you're like hey where was my<br></p><p><b>00:30:24.966 - 00:30:27.200</b><br>block trades there are no block trades<br></p><p><b>00:30:27.400 - 00:30:28.733</b><br>the thing bounces<br></p><p><b>00:30:29.000 - 00:30:31.700</b><br>but meanwhile you were safely underneath the base<br></p><p><b>00:30:32.100 - 00:30:33.666</b><br>it was totally safe to buy<br></p><p><b>00:30:33.666 - 00:30:34.366</b><br>you missed the<br></p><p><b>00:30:34.366 -
