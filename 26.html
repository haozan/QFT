00:00:19.066</b><br>just keeps on pushing<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.400 - 00:00:22.000</b><br>and then if we turn this to a four hour<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.100 - 00:00:24.333</b><br>so we can see that<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.366 -

00:00:37.566</b><br>gives us a nice pull back down to 340 320 or something<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.733 - 00:00:39.766</b><br>and then takes another run at it and then<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.766 - 00:00:40.566</b><br>breaks through<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.733 - 00:00:42.966</b><br>usually doesn't break through on its very first try<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.966 - 00:00:44.700</b><br>after something that's significant<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.333 - 00:00:46.466</b><br>but we'll see what happens<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.200 -

00:00:58.900</b><br>1 minute increments<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.700 - 00:01:02.100</b><br>so that I can keep trading while this is happening<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.200 - 00:01:02.966</b><br>the other side of the thing<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.966 - 00:01:04.866</b><br>the other thing is that I'm going to be going away<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.866 - 00:01:07.666</b><br>for two days so I won't be here for the next two days<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.100 -

00:01:16.566</b><br>oh man<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.566 - 00:01:19.133</b><br>I just got an awesome trade on the stock market here<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.133 - 00:01:20.933</b><br>give me one second I'm gonna go show you guys that<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.933 - 00:01:21.733</b><br>I know<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.733 - 00:01:23.600</b><br>it doesn't have anything to do with our coins but<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.933 - 00:01:25.166</b><br>oh man it was a beauty<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.666 - 00:01:28.666</b><br>okay so this one the ticker was sgmd<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.000 - 00:01:31.266</b><br>and I know you're looking at a line chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.600 - 00:01:32.366</b><br>so it might not look<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.366 - 00:01:33.500</b><br>just normal to you guys<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.500 - 00:01:34.966</b><br>since you're used to seeing candle charts<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.966 - 00:01:38.566</b><br>but anyway all the way from 45 from 4 cents<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.566 - 00:01:42.266</b><br>so from 45 all the way down to 22 you can't see the<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.500 - 00:01:43.800</b><br>22 but let's dump this down<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.800 - 00:01:45.000</b><br>it's a one month chart right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.000 - 00:01:47.200</b><br>so let's make that a two day chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.133 - 00:01:50.866</b><br>let's make that a one day chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.133 - 00:01:53.000</b><br>and then let's make that a<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.900 - 00:01:55.166</b><br>four hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.166 - 00:01:56.666</b><br>so it's really easy to see<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.666 - 00:01:59.066</b><br>and let's turn that to a candle chart so it's even<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.066 - 00:02:00.566</b><br>easier to look at<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.366 - 00:02:03.500</b><br>and then here's the beautiful trade<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.900 - 00:02:08.533</b><br>I started buying at 31 so right here I started buying<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.766 - 00:02:12.733</b><br>and then I got some 25s I think<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.100 - 00:02:16.400</b><br>let me go back in time here I think it was 25s I got<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.366 - 00:02:20.933</b><br>you can't go back that far but anyway yeah so I got 20<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.933 - 00:02:25.333</b><br>I got 30 ones I got 25s and then I got some 22<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.366 - 00:02:29.266</b><br>3s I think yeah so right here I got these 22 3s<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.266 - 00:02:31.866</b><br>so anyway I had made my average 24 on this<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.933 - 00:02:34.133</b><br>and I know this is penny stock trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.133 - 00:02:36.266</b><br>so it's not and it's really really fast<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.100 - 00:02:40.600</b><br>right here these candles are 1 minute candles so really<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.866 - 00:02:43.000</b><br>in the middle of this trade that was 1 minute<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.000 - 00:02:44.366</b><br>2 minute 3 minute<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.366 - 00:02:47.500</b><br>4 minute 5 minutes 6 minutes 7 minutes<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.733 - 00:02:48.966</b><br>before the bottom hit<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.366 - 00:02:50.166</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.266 - 00:02:54.166</b><br>within seven minutes I had bottom three times and<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.766 - 00:02:57.000</b><br>what you're looking for in penny stocks<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.166 - 00:02:58.866</b><br>is you're looking for a big buyer<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.866 - 00:03:00.466</b><br>just like in cryptoland<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.466 - 00:03:01.766</b><br>you're looking for a big buyer to come<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.766 - 00:03:03.000</b><br>and support the price<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.166 - 00:03:05.800</b><br>you're trying to figure out what is the bottom on this<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.966 - 00:03:08.900</b><br>so I'm buying because it's dropping really hard<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.000 - 00:03:11.566</b><br>and I'm loving that it's all little mounts you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.566 - 00:03:13.133</b><br>like 23 and 10 so<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.133 - 00:03:14.066</b><br>I'm buying like<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.066 - 00:03:16.733</b><br>400 dollars a shot or 500 dollars a shot<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.400 - 00:03:22.466</b><br>and then and then all of a sudden here at 222<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.933 - 00:03:26.166</b><br>a big guy came in and scooped up all the shares<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.166 - 00:03:28.800</b><br>so you know it's 10,000 10,000<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.800 - 00:03:31.466</b><br>50,000 10,000 10,000 10,000<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.466 -

00:03:40.466</b><br>would be $22,000 but we can just do it anyway<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.533 - 00:03:42.100</b><br>point zero to 2<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.933 - 00:03:45.400</b><br>* 1 million<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.400 - 00:03:47.966</b><br>is 22 thousand dollars<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.966 - 00:03:50.300</b><br>so this guy came in where all of us were buying<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.300 - 00:03:51.766</b><br>500 dollars of shot<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.800 -

00:06:47.000</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:06:47.866 - 00:06:49.266</b><br>looking at Neo here<br></p><p><b>00:06:49.800 - 00:06:50.166</b><br>somebody<br></p><p><b>00:06:50.166 - 00:06:52.666</b><br>yesterday was asking me about Neo because they were<br></p><p><b>00:06:52.766 - 00:06:54.600</b><br>they were calling this a base<br></p><p><b>00:06:55.066 - 00:06:56.166</b><br>they were saying you know<br></p><p><b>00:06:56.166 - 00:06:59.133</b><br>here's a base right here and then here's a base<br></p><p><b>00:06:59.200 - 00:06:59.900</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:06:59.900 - 00:07:03.166</b><br>which look at that bounce that was obviously a base<br></p><p><b>00:07:03.733 - 00:07:06.400</b><br>so they you know they're calling these 85's a base<br></p><p><b>00:07:06.400 - 00:07:07.533</b><br>and then they're like<br></p><p><b>00:07:07.900 - 00:07:09.766</b><br>you know widen it bounce back to the base<br></p><p><b>00:07:09.766 - 00:07:12.133</b><br>and if you zoom in over here you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:07:12.266 - 00:07:15.133</b><br>when it took its fall all the way down to 65<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.133 - 00:07:18.866</b><br>it only bounced back up to 81 82<br></p><p><b>00:07:18.866 - 00:07:22.133</b><br>you know like not all the way up to that 85<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.766 - 00:07:25.133</b><br>which I still classify as a pretty good bounce<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.133 - 00:07:27.000</b><br>and you should have been taking profits probably<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.000 - 00:07:29.466</b><br>in there why were you expecting it to go<br></p><p><b>00:07:29.466 - 00:07:30.800</b><br>all the way past the base<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.800 - 00:07:31.800</b><br>I don't know but<br></p><p><b>00:07:32.066 - 00:07:32.866</b><br>anyway<br></p><p><b>00:07:34.000 - 00:07:34.733</b><br>they were<br></p><p><b>00:07:34.733 -

00:07:42.533</b><br>first off<br></p><p><b>00:07:43.866 - 00:07:45.500</b><br>you've got to read the story of the chart<br></p><p><b>00:07:45.733 - 00:07:47.933</b><br>and you know here's a barely solid base<br></p><p><b>00:07:47.933 - 00:07:52.000</b><br>I definitely say this 75 area is a definite solid base<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.100 - 00:07:55.166</b><br>but over here this was also a very solid base<br></p><p><b>00:07:55.166 - 00:07:56.000</b><br>but it's so<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.000 - 00:07:56.800</b><br>but after<br></p><p><b>00:07:57.000 - 00:08:00.300</b><br>after a little bit of time it slowly lost its power<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.666 - 00:08:02.066</b><br>so you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.366 - 00:08:03.966</b><br>you have this bounce from<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.600 - 00:08:08.600</b><br>85 all the way up to 1:05 or 1:10 something like that<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.766 - 00:08:09.566</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:08:10.300 - 00:08:12.066</b><br>as it comes back down to retest that<br></p><p><b>00:08:12.066 - 00:08:13.566</b><br>you get another bounce over here<br></p><p><b>00:08:13.566 - 00:08:15.066</b><br>all the way up to<br></p><p><b>00:08:15.800 - 00:08:17.866</b><br>from 85 all the way up to 95<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.900 - 00:08:18.733</b><br></p><p><b>00:08:19.100 - 00:08:21.100</b><br>you know so less of a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:08:21.266 - 00:08:24.333</b><br>so less conviction in the buyers<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.800 - 00:08:26.866</b><br>and then every time it retests it<br></p><p><b>00:08:26.866 - 00:08:30.000</b><br>you get just a little bounce now so from 85<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.066 - 00:08:31.466</b><br>to 88 or something<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.766 - 00:08:33.500</b><br>and so you can see that slowly<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.500 - 00:08:35.466</b><br>slowly it's losing its conviction<br></p><p><b>00:08:35.533 - 00:08:39.066</b><br>and the buyers are not caring so much about this price<br></p><p><b>00:08:39.066 - 00:08:41.500</b><br>they're not so anxious to get in at this price<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.600 - 00:08:44.466</b><br>so the surprise won't be as much of a surprise<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.766 - 00:08:47.066</b><br>so anyway I wrote a post about that how<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.066 - 00:08:50.133</b><br>when you start to see this consolidation and<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.133 - 00:08:50.800</b><br>things are getting<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.800 - 00:08:52.400</b><br>tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter<br></p><p><b>00:08:52.400 -

00:11:57.966</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:11:57.966 - 00:11:59.800</b><br>and that is a big<br></p><p><b>00:11:59.800 - 00:12:02.666</b><br>big signal to us that it's a good thing to trade<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.700 - 00:12:03.166</b><br>if there's<br></p><p><b>00:12:03.166 - 00:12:05.800</b><br>lots of volume and everybody's talking about it<br></p><p><b>00:12:05.933 - 00:12:09.133</b><br>bases will be respected that's just how it works<br></p><p><b>00:12:09.166 - 00:12:10.600</b><br>so and then you look at<br></p><p><b>00:12:11.166 - 00:12:12.933</b><br>this chart and it's like<br></p><p><b>00:12:13.366 - 00:12:15.300</b><br>here let me move my camera a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.500 - 00:12:16.500</b><br>sorry I'm having a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:12:16.500 - 00:12:18.100</b><br>technical difficulty with this camera<br></p><p><b>00:12:19.700 - 00:12:21.700</b><br>so I don't know where are your bases on this<br></p><p><b>00:12:21.700 - 00:12:23.866</b><br>and how does this thing usually respond<br></p><p><b>00:12:23.866 - 00:12:24.666</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:12:25.166 - 00:12:26.133</b><br>you know already<br></p><p><b>00:12:26.133 - 00:12:27.733</b><br>that there's a lot of people talking about this<br></p><p><b>00:12:27.733 - 00:12:28.733</b><br>that there's a lot of volume<br></p><p><b>00:12:28.733 - 00:12:29.900</b><br>so you know there's going to be a lot of<br></p><p><b>00:12:29.900 - 00:12:31.100</b><br>sellers that can panic<br></p><p><b>00:12:31.100 - 00:12:32.400</b><br>and there's going to be a lot of buyers<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.400 - 00:12:33.266</b><br>that are going to buy it up<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.266 - 00:12:34.366</b><br>the second they see a panic<br></p><p><b>00:12:34.366 - 00:12:35.166</b><br>and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:12:35.400 - 00:12:38.066</b><br>so very easy to call this a base over here right<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.100 - 00:12:39.566</b><br>really really clear and easy<br></p><p><b>00:12:39.566 - 00:12:41.266</b><br>look at that big huge bounce<br></p><p><b>00:12:41.400 - 00:12:44.900</b><br>and you might be able to call this right here a base<br></p><p><b>00:12:45.266 - 00:12:46.466</b><br>because that's like<br></p><p><b>00:12:46.466 - 00:12:49.200</b><br>all the way from 680 all the way up to 840<br></p><p><b>00:12:49.200 - 00:12:51.000</b><br>that's pretty big bounce right there<br></p><p><b>00:12:51.066 - 00:12:53.600</b><br>so you might be able to call out a base and if you did<br></p><p><b>00:12:53.866 - 00:12:56.766</b><br>then look at this beautiful buying opportunity<br></p><p><b>00:12:56.900 - 00:12:59.000</b><br>where it gets all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:12:59.866 - 00:13:03.966</b><br>565 and goes all the way up to 731<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.966 - 00:13:04.733</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:13:04.733 - 00:13:06.166</b><br>those are big percentages right<br></p><p><b>00:13:06.166 - 00:13:09.400</b><br>so this is clearly clearly<br></p><p><b>00:13:09.600 - 00:13:12.133</b><br>where I'm looking for my next crack<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.333 - 00:13:14.933</b><br>now this thing is so argumentative<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.066 - 00:13:19.266</b><br>that every time that it gives even just a little bit of<br></p><p><b>00:13:19.400 - 00:13:20.533</b><br>a crack<br></p><p><b>00:13:20.666 - 00:13:23.366</b><br>of what I wouldn't even call a bass but even though<br></p><p><b>00:13:23.533 - 00:13:24.933</b><br>just a little bit of a drop<br></p><p><b>00:13:24.933 - 00:13:26.066</b><br>boom you get a<br></p><p><b>00:13:26.166 - 00:13:26.733</b><br>bounce<br></p><p><b>00:13:26.733 - 00:13:28.333</b><br>just a little bit of a drop<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.800 - 00:13:30.400</b><br>boom you get a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:13:30.500 - 00:13:34.200</b><br>just a little bit of a drop boom you get a huge bounce<br></p><p><b>00:13:34.300 - 00:13:35.466</b><br>so like you know<br></p><p><b>00:13:35.466 - 00:13:37.966</b><br>yesterday I was watching this area right here<br></p><p><b>00:13:37.966 - 00:13:41.500</b><br>hoping for a drop to like 460 420<br></p><p><b>00:13:41.533 - 00:13:43.466</b><br>I mean I want percentage right<br></p><p><b>00:13:43.466 - 00:13:45.700</b><br>I don't want to buy right underneath the base<br></p><p><b>00:13:45.700 - 00:13:48.566</b><br>so if I'm calling the base you know 560 ish<br></p><p><b>00:13:48.900 - 00:13:51.000</b><br>I don't want to buy it like 5<br></p><p><b>00:13:51.000 - 00:13:52.166</b><br></p><p><b>00:13:52.466 - 00:13:54.400</b><br>I don't want to try to make you know<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.400 - 00:13:56.933</b><br>I don't know 5% or 6% or something<br></p><p><b>00:13:57.133 - 00:13:58.266</b><br>I want to make 10%<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.266 - 00:13:59.066</b><br>I want to make<br></p><p><b>00:13:59.133 - 00:14:00.866</b><br>15 percent I want to make 20 percent<br></p><p><b>00:14:00.866 - 00:14:02.533</b><br>I want to make some big percentages<br></p><p><b>00:14:02.666 - 00:14:04.866</b><br>so in this case I didn't get in at all<br></p><p><b>00:14:04.866 - 00:14:06.500</b><br>I didn't get a nibble I didn't get nothing<br></p><p><b>00:14:06.900 - 00:14:08.400</b><br>but meanwhile from 5<br></p><p><b>00:14:08.400 - 00:14:11.000</b><br>17 it bounced all the way up over 600<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.066 - 00:14:11.866</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.866 - 00:14:13.666</b><br>you know there's clearly I don't know 15<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.666 - 00:14:15.700</b><br>18 percent of a move<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.700 - 00:14:17.533</b><br>that's just beautiful right<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.600 - 00:14:21.166</b><br>but there's no way for me to play that because<br></p><p><b>00:14:21.166 - 00:14:23.133</b><br>I really was waiting for a drop<br></p><p><b>00:14:23.333 - 00:14:24.266</b><br>meanwhile<br></p><p><b>00:14:24.933 - 00:14:27.366</b><br>that's how strong this is so<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.400 - 00:14:28.800</b><br>now can you see how<br></p><p><b>00:14:29.066 - 00:14:30.966</b><br>the way other traders will look at this<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.966 - 00:14:32.566</b><br>and the way we'll look at this<br></p><p><b>00:14:32.800 - 00:14:33.466</b><br>other traders will<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.466 - 00:14:34.166</b><br>be like oh man<br></p><p><b>00:14:34.166 - 00:14:35.333</b><br>this thing is going to die off<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.333 - 00:14:36.666</b><br>and let's not touch this<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.266 - 00:14:39.900</b><br>whereas I look at this and be like wow<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.133 - 00:14:43.000</b><br>this has such huge opportunity for us<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.266 - 00:14:45.200</b><br>because there's such a thick argument<br></p><p><b>00:14:45.300 - 00:14:48.766</b><br>because look at these how it just cannot fall<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.933 - 00:14:52.066</b><br>every time it even tries to panic it gets about<br></p><p><b>00:14:52.200 - 00:14:54.766</b><br>so do you really think that off<br></p><p><b>00:14:54.766 - 00:14:57.100</b><br>a real good panic it's not<br></p><p><b>00:14:57.100 - 00:14:58.933</b><br>gonna bounce back to its base<br></p><p><b>00:14:59.133 - 00:15:02.266</b><br>I mean there's just no chance a really good panic<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.466 - 00:15:05.333</b><br>something happens where everybody just ahh<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.000 - 00:15:07.400</b><br>and we're going to get this<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.500 - 00:15:10.466</b><br>huge massive bounce and make big percentages but<br></p><p><b>00:15:10.566 - 00:15:13.133</b><br>it's hard it's hard to be patient<br></p><p><b>00:15:13.133 - 00:15:14.866</b><br>it's hard to wait for that to happen<br></p><p><b>00:15:15.200 - 00:15:17.266</b><br>but it's a clear clear example<br></p><p><b>00:15:17.500 - 00:15:18.300</b><br>of<br></p><p><b>00:15:19.200 - 00:15:20.466</b><br>a strong opportunity<br></p><p><b>00:15:21.333 - 00:15:23.200</b><br>so something else I wanted to touch on today<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.566 - 00:15:25.866</b><br>so in our Slack chatroom<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.533 -

00:15:33.366</b><br>trades<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.366 - 00:15:35.533</b><br>we're all watching the bases and trying to find those<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.533 - 00:15:37.900</b><br>trades so it's a fantastic place to be<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.766 - 00:15:40.900</b><br>I noticed that on Hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:15:40.900 - 00:15:41.600</b><br>today<br></p><p><b>00:15:41.600 - 00:15:44.200</b><br>that all of my balances were<br></p><p><b>00:15:44.666 -

00:15:58.566</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:15:58.566 - 00:16:01.400</b><br>I was trading it mainly there because it was in USD<br></p><p><b>00:16:02.300 - 00:16:05.000</b><br>so now I'm starting to move my money from there<br></p><p><b>00:16:05.000 - 00:16:09.533</b><br>but anyway so I asked in the room does anyone know why<br></p><p><b>00:16:09.966 - 00:16:13.333</b><br>Hitbit is now in USD instead of USD<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.733 - 00:16:15.600</b><br>and this is the benefit of this room<br></p><p><b>00:16:15.600 -
