00:00:42.933</b><br>I just want to talk about<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.933 - 00:00:44.466</b><br>EOS for a second because it's been going<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.466 - 00:00:46.100</b><br>crazy for the past few days<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.566 - 00:00:47.700</b><br>look at this run up<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.700 - 00:00:49.866</b><br>and I actually got it right over here at about<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.866 - 00:00:53.500</b><br>50 cents I bought it using EOS Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.933 - 00:00:56.400</b><br>so if I switch over to that you'll see that right<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.466 - 00:00:59.333</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.666 - 00:01:03.933</b><br>here I got in right there on that little tail<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.733 - 00:01:07.100</b><br>which was awesome and then I sold into this run up<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.800 - 00:01:09.766</b><br>let me just put that back to where it was<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.333 - 00:01:14.666</b><br>and let's go USD<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.133 - 00:01:17.300</b><br>so anyway just I'm putting it on USD<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.300 - 00:01:19.133</b><br>so you guys can see actually see the price<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.133 - 00:01:22.100</b><br>so it ran all the way up to somewhere near $7<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.300 - 00:01:23.100</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.766 - 00:01:25.800</b><br>when it was running up there on my last video<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.800 - 00:01:26.866</b><br>I said to everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.866 - 00:01:29.400</b><br>you know don't go crazy and start buying this thing<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.900 - 00:01:32.900</b><br>because they're going to be putting out their ICO<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.200 - 00:01:36.133</b><br>they're going to be selling coins for an entire year<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.133 - 00:01:36.933</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.466 - 00:01:39.933</b><br>you know right now in China and everything it's going<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.000 - 00:01:42.366</b><br>like crazy everybody's just buying this thing up<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.366 - 00:01:45.133</b><br>and then of course you get this massive dip<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.133 - 00:01:46.266</b><br>look at that dip<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.300 - 00:01:49.400</b><br>holy smokes all the way down to two bucks<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.400 - 00:01:51.100</b><br>and then bounce all the way down<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.133 - 00:01:52.666</b><br>all the way up to five bucks<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.866 - 00:01:54.933</b><br>so like these huge moves<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.933 - 00:01:57.800</b><br>and you know where I bought it at 50 cents<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.800 - 00:01:59.700</b><br>it went all the way up to $7<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.700 - 00:02:02.000</b><br>over $7 like 780 or something<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.933 - 00:02:04.333</b><br>so what a crazy thing<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.333 - 00:02:06.533</b><br>of course I didn't sell you know way up there<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.533 - 00:02:08.266</b><br>I sold somewhere in this area<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.166 - 00:02:09.666</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.666 - 00:02:11.800</b><br>now I just wanted to mention to you guys that now<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.866 - 00:02:13.133</b><br>we're getting some dips<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.133 - 00:02:14.866</b><br>so a few seconds ago<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.066 - 00:02:17.466</b><br>it dipped all the way down to $2<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.466 - 00:02:19.100</b><br>and now it's back at 281<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.166 - 00:02:20.933</b><br>these are huge percentages guys<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.100 - 00:02:23.800</b><br>so right now if I was drawing basis<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.300 - 00:02:26.200</b><br>I would have put a base in here somewhere<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.400 - 00:02:29.466</b><br>I did not catch this this little dip to $2<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.900 - 00:02:31.733</b><br>but anything under $2<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.766 - 00:02:34.133</b><br>you know like right now $2 would be your base<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.900 - 00:02:35.700</b><br>short term<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.800 - 00:02:39.700</b><br>anything under $2 you get a nice beautiful quick bounce<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.733 - 00:02:41.733</b><br>so I'm going to be setting up some orders at<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.733 -
