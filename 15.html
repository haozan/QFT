00:00:04.600</b><br>questions and<br></p><p><b>00:00:04.600 - 00:00:07.100</b><br>comments in my stomach blog so I'm all caught up<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.100 - 00:00:07.900</b><br>so that's awesome<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.933 - 00:00:09.600</b><br>and I thought I'd make a quick video right now<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.600 - 00:00:12.200</b><br>just to discuss what's happening with Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.100 - 00:00:15.566</b><br>on the charts and what I know about<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.566 - 00:00:16.800</b><br>what's happening with bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.866 - 00:00:17.666</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.133 - 00:00:20.366</b><br>the Segwet thing that's happening is causing<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.366 - 00:00:22.466</b><br>bitcoin to take a little bit of a turn here<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.300 - 00:00:24.700</b><br>it's starting to go down and I<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.700 - 00:00:26.266</b><br>just don't know how low it's gonna go<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.400 - 00:00:28.100</b><br>because there's a lot of fear in the markets now<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.100 - 00:00:30.400</b><br>because of this little split that might happen<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.400 - 00:00:33.566</b><br>where there's a new thing called bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.400 - 00:00:35.600</b><br>where they're talking about<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.700 - 00:00:38.500</b><br>a fork that's gonna cause you to have<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.800 - 00:00:40.466</b><br>bitcoin and bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.866 - 00:00:43.866</b><br>which a lot of people are saying is not a big deal<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.866 - 00:00:45.466</b><br>and that Bitcoin cache is not going to<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.466 - 00:00:47.966</b><br>become anything and so Bitcoin will just stay the same<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.166 - 00:00:51.066</b><br>and it will be improved with the whole Segwit thing<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.066 - 00:00:52.866</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.766 - 00:00:56.933</b><br>I don't know right and then there's<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.333 - 00:00:59.466</b><br>some wallets like treasure wallets<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.933 - 00:01:03.766</b><br>that are going to split your coins for you so<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.266 - 00:01:06.066</b><br>they're going to support both<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.066 - 00:01:08.200</b><br>both coins so if you have bitcoin then<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.200 - 00:01:09.466</b><br>all of a sudden you're going to have<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.500 - 00:01:11.300</b><br>the next day you're going to have bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.866 - 00:01:15.933</b><br>cache BCC and<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.766 - 00:01:18.400</b><br>you can use them both or you can<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.400 - 00:01:20.666</b><br>take your BCC and turn it back into Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.166 - 00:01:23.966</b><br>and then increase your bitcoins so<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.200 - 00:01:26.133</b><br>anyway if you've got your bitcoin at<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.133 - 00:01:28.500</b><br>exchanges like at Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.533 - 00:01:31.933</b><br>or like Kraken or like Poloniacs<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.500 - 00:01:34.400</b><br>don't know what they're gonna do<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.400 - 00:01:36.766</b><br>I don't know if they're gonna support both both<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.133 - 00:01:40.466</b><br>chains so you might end up with just bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.966 - 00:01:44.200</b><br>when you could have had bitcoin and bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.700 - 00:01:46.000</b><br>so I'm pulling most<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.000 - 00:01:48.566</b><br>of my bitcoin off the exchanges right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.600 - 00:01:51.266</b><br>and sticking it into my wallets<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.966 - 00:01:55.066</b><br>so that I control my own private keys and then<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.200 - 00:01:56.766</b><br>whatever happens August 1st<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.966 - 00:01:59.200</b><br>then I'm set up to deal with that<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.100 - 00:02:02.533</b><br>but if you leave it on exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.766 - 00:02:05.866</b><br>then it just depends what that exchange is going to do<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.966 - 00:02:06.766</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.666 - 00:02:11.133</b><br>I've been searching Bitrex and<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.200 - 00:02:14.666</b><br>Krak and Poloniacs and trying to find out<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.666 - 00:02:16.066</b><br>what these guys are planning to do<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.100 - 00:02:17.000</b><br>and Bitrex said that<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.000 - 00:02:18.666</b><br>they're going to make an announcement soon<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.400 - 00:02:22.966</b><br>of what their plans are if there is a fork and if<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.166 - 00:02:24.766</b><br>there is this new coin called<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.300 - 00:02:27.333</b><br>bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.533 - 00:02:30.666</b><br>and even right now bitcoin cache is trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.933 - 00:02:33.300</b><br>on futures in China<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.500 - 00:02:34.166</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.166 - 00:02:36.066</b><br>they're really expecting that this is going to happen<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.400 - 00:02:37.900</b><br>so anyway because of all that fear<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.900 - 00:02:39.100</b><br>and nobody knows what they're doing<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.100 - 00:02:40.700</b><br>and also one more<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.066 - 00:02:43.100</b><br>if you're trying to move your<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.100 - 00:02:46.166</b><br>Bitcoin off of Bitrex or some of these exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.566 - 00:02:48.866</b><br>they're making it a delayed process right now<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.866 - 00:02:50.200</b><br>and I figured that eventually<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.200 - 00:02:51.200</b><br>they're just going to stop<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.200 - 00:02:52.533</b><br>allowing you to remove<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.200 - 00:02:55.700</b><br>your stuff so you really want to<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.733 - 00:02:57.866</b><br>if you're planning to do this you want to remove your<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.066 - 00:02:59.966</b><br>bitcoin off those exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.133 - 00:03:00.933</b><br>now<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.500 - 00:03:02.600</b><br>in a day or two<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.900 - 00:03:04.533</b><br>they might halt<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.133 - 00:03:07.666</b><br>transfers and then you can't do anything with it so<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.866 - 00:03:10.700</b><br>you know like I really don't think<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.800 - 00:03:12.766</b><br>that like personally I don't think that<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.166 - 00:03:15.733</b><br>this is going to affect Bitcoin too much<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.166 - 00:03:17.733</b><br>except for in all<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.700 - 00:03:21.566</b><br>of this worry causing the price to drop<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.566 - 00:03:24.266</b><br>and of course that's also causing Ethereum to drop<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.733 - 00:03:26.300</b><br>right here you can see<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.300 - 00:03:28.133</b><br>the theorem is also taking a little bit of a turn<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.066 - 00:03:29.666</b><br>beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.666 - 00:03:31.133</b><br>it's going to be beautiful to pick up some more<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.133 - 00:03:33.000</b><br>theorem if it really dies for us<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.966 - 00:03:34.766</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.100 - 00:03:36.900</b><br>bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.466 - 00:03:39.666</b><br>so like you could say<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.666 - 00:03:41.266</b><br>okay now you know there's news<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.266 - 00:03:42.700</b><br>you know that there's a reason<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.700 - 00:03:44.000</b><br>for the fear in the market<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.000 - 00:03:45.966</b><br>and if you were drawing your bases and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.966 - 00:03:47.500</b><br>you could easily call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.500 - 00:03:49.266</b><br>because you got a nice bounce off of it<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.800 - 00:03:51.866</b><br>and you could say that this broke the base<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.866 - 00:03:53.866</b><br>which means we're in a safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.366 - 00:03:56.200</b><br>but you'll notice if you scroll in<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.466 - 00:03:58.133</b><br>that it broke the base<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.566 - 00:04:01.000</b><br>and then it dropped all the way from 26<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.000 - 00:04:03.100</b><br>all the way down to 24 or<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.200 - 00:04:04.500</b><br>60 or something like that<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.500 - 00:04:06.933</b><br>and then bounce all the way back up to 26<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.300 - 00:04:10.933</b><br>so it already gave you a bounce off of that crack<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.333 - 00:04:14.366</b><br>so that means we could grind lower here<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.500 - 00:04:17.066</b><br>so I would start like now that we're into this<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.066 - 00:04:19.166</b><br>I would be playing off this bass over here<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.200 - 00:04:20.000</b><br>this would be<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.500 - 00:04:20.933</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.933 - 00:04:23.100</b><br>if you didn't play off of this one and already<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.100 - 00:04:24.600</b><br>start in and already received<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.600 - 00:04:26.000</b><br>you know some profit for it<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.166 - 00:04:28.300</b><br>I would start to think about this base<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.900 - 00:04:31.133</b><br>because this could really really fall<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.866 - 00:04:35.366</b><br>you're probably safe anyway this is<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.533 - 00:04:37.166</b><br>no matter how we draw this circle<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.166 - 00:04:39.566</b><br>it's probably going to bounce right back up to here<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.766 - 00:04:40.566</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.600 - 00:04:43.500</b><br>this is probably just one big long safe circle anyway<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.800 - 00:04:44.600</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.100 - 00:04:46.733</b><br>just because we know<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.500 - 00:04:49.700</b><br>the reason for this panic is not<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.700 - 00:04:51.066</b><br>because we crack the base<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.066 - 00:04:53.333</b><br>the reason that for this panic is because<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.700 - 00:04:57.200</b><br>of this possible fork in Bitcoin and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.400 - 00:04:59.766</b><br>I'm a little bit less<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.200 - 00:05:01.200</b><br>eager to jump in<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.200 - 00:05:03.366</b><br>you know I'd like it to fall a little bit harder<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.900 - 00:05:06.133</b><br>before I get in so anyway that's<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.733 - 00:05:09.133</b><br>let me just pause the video<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.466 - 00:05:10.966</b><br>sorry about that I always got<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.133 - 00:05:13.533</b><br>alerts and trades going off like crazy<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.866 - 00:05:17.533</b><br>people have been posting some beautiful charts in<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.933 - 00:05:19.200</b><br>my blog lately<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.400 - 00:05:21.266</b><br>showing their trades which is fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.266 -

00:05:44.133</b><br>I was look I like the chart guys<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.133 - 00:05:46.166</b><br>I like to go watch the chart guys<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.766 - 00:05:49.000</b><br>in the in the stock market I have often<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.000 - 00:05:50.733</b><br>gone to take a look at their videos because<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.300 - 00:05:53.466</b><br>not that I laugh at them or that I find humorous<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.466 - 00:05:54.900</b><br>it's just it's just<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.966 - 00:05:56.166</b><br>a different perspective<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.166 - 00:05:57.700</b><br>the way they look at the market and<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.700 - 00:05:59.700</b><br>the way they were looking at this market<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.700 - 00:06:01.866</b><br>the chart guys were saying that<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.533 - 00:06:04.566</b><br>you know this is a bare flag<br></p><p><b>00:06:04.566 - 00:06:07.400</b><br>so here let me I mean a bullflag<br></p><p><b>00:06:07.400 - 00:06:08.500</b><br>so here<br></p><p><b>00:06:09.333 - 00:06:12.133</b><br>if you were to just sorry<br></p><p><b>00:06:13.200 - 00:06:16.133</b><br>if you were to just move it past where it fell<br></p><p><b>00:06:16.366 - 00:06:18.266</b><br>they were looking at this and saying you know<br></p><p><b>00:06:18.366 - 00:06:20.366</b><br>higher lows higher lows higher lows<br></p><p><b>00:06:20.366 - 00:06:23.266</b><br>and this is your typical bull flag<br></p><p><b>00:06:23.300 - 00:06:24.466</b><br>so this should<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.700 - 00:06:26.533</b><br>bitcoin should just take off any moment<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.666 - 00:06:28.400</b><br>and then all of a sudden this happens<br></p><p><b>00:06:28.400 - 00:06:32.700</b><br>and so they hit their stops and they got stopped<br></p><p><b>00:06:33.266 - 00:06:35.866</b><br>out of their positions and they took a little loss<br></p><p><b>00:06:35.866 - 00:06:37.200</b><br>and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:06:38.600 - 00:06:40.200</b><br>so what are they going to say<br></p><p><b>00:06:40.200 - 00:06:42.500</b><br>to all the people that are watching or that<br></p><p><b>00:06:42.500 - 00:06:44.866</b><br>you know that hopefully took their losses fast enough<br></p><p><b>00:06:47.300 - 00:06:49.466</b><br>how are they going to comment on this and here's<br></p><p><b>00:06:49.533 - 00:06:51.566</b><br>I don't know if I can play a video on<br></p><p><b>00:06:52.133 - 00:06:54.333</b><br>on a video I'm not sure if you<br></p><p><b>00:06:54.333 - 00:06:55.800</b><br>guys can hear what's happening on the computer<br></p><p><b>00:06:55.800 - 00:06:58.533</b><br>but here just give me one second I'll queue it up<br></p><p><b>00:06:58.800 - 00:06:59.600</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:07:00.300 - 00:07:02.500</b><br>here it is and<br></p><p><b>00:07:03.133 - 00:07:05.800</b><br>it's at 5 it's at 545 on this video<br></p><p><b>00:07:05.800 - 00:07:07.300</b><br>I mean he just released this video<br></p><p><b>00:07:07.966 - 00:07:11.133</b><br>today and it's almost laughable what he says<br></p><p><b>00:07:11.200 - 00:07:14.466</b><br>so it was so crazy that I had to comment<br></p><p><b>00:07:14.466 - 00:07:15.733</b><br>and I'll show you my comment after<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.733 - 00:07:16.800</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:07:16.866 - 00:07:18.300</b><br>we'll just listen to this for a second<br></p><p><b>00:07:18.533 - 00:07:21.600</b><br>so that's why I suggest keeping your stop loss level<br></p><p><b>00:07:21.666 - 00:07:24.166</b><br>getting back to cash and being able to sit back<br></p><p><b>00:07:24.166 - 00:07:25.400</b><br>on the sidelines<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.400 - 00:07:26.866</b><br>reassess the situation<br></p><p><b>00:07:26.866 - 00:07:28.933</b><br>and then get back to your game plan and keep<br></p><p><b>00:07:28.933 - 00:07:30.866</b><br>knocking out these profitable traits<br></p><p><b>00:07:31.200 - 00:07:33.400</b><br>hitting base hits to recover that loss<br></p><p><b>00:07:33.666 - 00:07:35.733</b><br>so talking into the world<br></p><p><b>00:07:36.266 - 00:07:37.133</b><br>losses happen<br></p><p><b>00:07:37.200 - 00:07:40.166</b><br>all the time and we need to completely shake them off<br></p><p><b>00:07:40.266 - 00:07:41.966</b><br>and again that lack of fear<br></p><p><b>00:07:42.000 - 00:07:44.100</b><br>is very hard for me to convey that to people<br></p><p><b>00:07:44.200 - 00:07:45.133</b><br>it really takes<br></p><p><b>00:07:45.133 - 00:07:47.866</b><br>admittedly it takes a lot of experience and<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.200 - 00:07:50.333</b><br>lessons learning lessons<br></p><p><b>00:07:50.333 - 00:07:51.700</b><br>so the good thing about a loss is you learn<br></p><p><b>00:07:51.700 - 00:07:53.700</b><br>a lot more about a loss than you want to win<br></p><p><b>00:07:53.900 - 00:07:55.400</b><br>in terms of reviewing the tree<br></p><p><b>00:07:55.600 - 00:07:56.966</b><br>but just<br></p><p><b>00:07:57.200 - 00:07:57.966</b><br>over time<br></p><p><b>00:07:57.966 - 00:08:00.600</b><br>hit numbers of losses because they happen so often<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.700 - 00:08:02.500</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.900 - 00:08:06.400</b><br>okay it takes a lot of experience taking losses<br></p><p><b>00:08:06.500 - 00:08:08.666</b><br>to not worry about losses anymore<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.700 - 00:08:10.300</b><br>and you get numb<br></p><p><b>00:08:10.600 -

00:08:22.366</b><br>a stop loss set up and hopefully<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.366 - 00:08:23.100</b><br>everybody got out<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.100 - 00:08:24.700</b><br>because they had a stop loss<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.700 - 00:08:26.100</b><br>and they took a loss<br></p><p><b>00:08:26.100 - 00:08:27.766</b><br>and don't worry about it<br></p><p><b>00:08:27.766 - 00:08:29.933</b><br>because losses are just part of the game<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.000 -
