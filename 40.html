00:00:31.066</b><br>and there'll be like a million<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.066 - 00:00:32.666</b><br>people playing sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.666 - 00:00:35.200</b><br>and he'll come on and he'll give you a question<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.566 - 00:00:37.133</b><br>gives you 15 questions<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.333 - 00:00:39.200</b><br>and then it's multiple<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.200 - 00:00:40.566</b><br>choices underneath that question<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.666 - 00:00:43.566</b><br>and so he'll ask this question<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.933 - 00:00:46.500</b><br>you have six seconds to hit the button<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.733 - 00:00:48.466</b><br>and make your selection<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.600 - 00:00:50.200</b><br>and if you get the answer right<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.200 - 00:00:52.366</b><br>then you get to move on to the next question<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.733 - 00:00:54.900</b><br>if you get it wrong then you get disqualified<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.900 - 00:00:55.766</b><br>so like you'll have<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.900 - 00:00:59.266</b><br>let's say the game is for 20 thousand dollars<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.100 - 00:01:01.866</b><br>and you have a million people playing<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.966 - 00:01:03.600</b><br>you know maybe after a few questions<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.600 - 00:01:06.000</b><br>you're down to like 400 thousand people playing<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.000 - 00:01:08.100</b><br>and then after the next question you're down to<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.266 - 00:01:09.566</b><br>220 thousand people playing<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.566 - 00:01:11.200</b><br>and as people get the questions wrong<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.200 - 00:01:12.366</b><br>they get disqualified<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.366 - 00:01:14.566</b><br>and only the people who get the questions right<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.566 - 00:01:15.700</b><br>move on in the game<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.800 - 00:01:17.900</b><br>and at the end on the last question<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.600 - 00:01:20.966</b><br>if you made it through all 15 questions<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.066 - 00:01:23.933</b><br>then you split the prize with whoever's left<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.100 - 00:01:26.800</b><br>so there might be like 100 people left by the 15th<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.800 - 00:01:27.600</b><br>question<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.666 - 00:01:30.800</b><br>and so they all split 20 thousand dollars anyway<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.600 - 00:01:34.500</b><br>I recorded today's game just a clip of it<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.533 -
