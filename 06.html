00:00:05.133</b><br>and I thought<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.133 - 00:00:07.000</b><br>I just take 2 seconds just to talk to you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.000 - 00:00:08.766</b><br>about what's happening on the markets<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.966 - 00:00:11.966</b><br>coin all the coins are dropping<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.366 - 00:00:13.733</b><br>pretty hard most of the coins anyway<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.733 - 00:00:15.066</b><br>most of the coins I'm following<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.100 - 00:00:17.200</b><br>look at this crazy trade I'm in<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.000 - 00:00:21.933</b><br>on amp so you can see that I took this dip over here<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.166 - 00:00:24.800</b><br>I just made this little tiny percentage earlier<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.966 - 00:00:26.566</b><br>because I want to own amp<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.700 - 00:00:29.200</b><br>it's another social media type thing like steam itch<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.200 - 00:00:29.600</b><br>but of<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.600 - 00:00:31.700</b><br>course they don't have a platform yet or something<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.200 - 00:00:33.500</b><br>but anyway I want to own it<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.533 - 00:00:35.300</b><br>and look how beautiful this chart is<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.300 - 00:00:36.900</b><br>just gorgeous as it's going up<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.000 - 00:00:39.566</b><br>so you know I bought this little crack over here<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.700 - 00:00:42.733</b><br>I got in right there I sold right right there<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.933 - 00:00:44.700</b><br>and of course it bounced all the way up to there<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.700 - 00:00:46.866</b><br>and then I waited for a nice crack of this<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.366 - 00:00:49.500</b><br>and here let me draw that so that<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.500 - 00:00:50.966</b><br>it makes it easy for everybody<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.100 - 00:00:53.600</b><br>nice crack of that and I got that crack<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.666 - 00:00:56.466</b><br>and you know I should have probably sold right here<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.733 - 00:00:58.866</b><br>but I want to own it you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.500 - 00:01:00.766</b><br>I was like oh man<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.766 - 00:01:03.366</b><br>that is just too nice on a chart that looks like that<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.600 - 00:01:06.366</b><br>so it came back to the base of course<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.366 - 00:01:07.933</b><br>now here's your next base right<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.933 - 00:01:09.333</b><br>and it cracked that base<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.333 - 00:01:11.000</b><br>and look at this little bounce<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.000 - 00:01:13.600</b><br>not even close to the previous base<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.666 - 00:01:16.866</b><br>so that tells you that this is making a real big dive<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.933 - 00:01:18.500</b><br>so of course I bought some more<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.133 - 00:01:20.966</b><br>and you can see I have an order here to buy some more<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.966 - 00:01:22.666</b><br>and I'll put a few mortars down below<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.766 - 00:01:24.866</b><br>I'll try to get whatever I can because<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.400 - 00:01:26.533</b><br>once things start<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.733 - 00:01:28.300</b><br>I just want to use this as an example<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.300 - 00:01:28.966</b><br>once things start<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.966 - 00:01:31.300</b><br>falling this hard on a beautiful chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.666 - 00:01:33.533</b><br>what generally happens is<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.533 - 00:01:36.100</b><br>you have to go back and look at big bases<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.100 - 00:01:38.800</b><br>so this is really your big base over here<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.800 - 00:01:41.466</b><br>you know where it hit this and took that big jump<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.466 - 00:01:43.766</b><br>and where it hit it again and took that big jump<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.866 - 00:01:45.866</b><br>so this is really your big base<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.866 - 00:01:48.500</b><br>so all of the bys that I'm making down here<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.666 - 00:01:50.566</b><br>are going to return to here<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.766 - 00:01:52.700</b><br>I'm gonna be able to sell over here sometime<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.766 - 00:01:54.966</b><br>so let's revisit this into the future<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.533 - 00:01:57.400</b><br>you know we can't do anything about it right now but<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.500 - 00:01:58.800</b><br>let's revisit it in the future<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.800 - 00:01:59.400</b><br>you're gonna see that<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.400 - 00:02:00.933</b><br>I just keep on buying and buying it<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.933 - 00:02:03.533</b><br>I want to own it anyway so I'm happy to buy it<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.666 - 00:02:06.266</b><br>and when it bounces back halfway<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.466 - 00:02:07.766</b><br>so let's say I<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.266 - 00:02:10.400</b><br>got this one over here or even where I am right now<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.400 - 00:02:11.933</b><br>let's say this was the very<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.933 - 00:02:14.300</b><br>last bottom and it bounces back to around<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.300 - 00:02:16.333</b><br>this level around half of where I'm in<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.700 - 00:02:17.866</b><br>I'll just sell half<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.333 - 00:02:19.400</b><br>just to be safe<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.500 - 00:02:22.133</b><br>and keep all the rest for that nice bounce<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.533 - 00:02:24.533</b><br>maybe sell a little bit more here and then stay up<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.533 - 00:02:25.200</b><br>right on<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.200 - 00:02:28.200</b><br>keep all my profits for into the future as it goes up<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.400 - 00:02:31.400</b><br>but anyway this is one of those charts where<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.533 - 00:02:33.466</b><br>it's falling hard and it's falling hard<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.466 - 00:02:34.533</b><br>with the market<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.533 - 00:02:35.933</b><br>the whole market's falling hard<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.366 - 00:02:38.533</b><br>so I'm not so worried about it<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.533 - 00:02:41.133</b><br>because it's not a reflection of amp<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.133 - 00:02:43.266</b><br>it's a reflection of the market is falling hard<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.266 - 00:02:43.766</b><br>and amp<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.766 - 00:02:46.466</b><br>is taking a really serious dive off this market<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.133 - 00:02:49.000</b><br>like look at Bay for instance<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.000 - 00:02:50.766</b><br>which would be a totally normal<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.766 - 00:02:51.566</b><br>trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.133 - 00:02:56.200</b><br>coin here you can see like a clear base right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.200 - 00:02:57.533</b><br>you can see where I bought bought<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.533 - 00:02:59.466</b><br>bought and sold on the bounce<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.466 - 00:03:00.866</b><br>and it bounced all the way to there<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.866 - 00:03:02.333</b><br>you know and I kept some but<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.400 - 00:03:04.366</b><br>I never sold it because I want it again<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.466 - 00:03:06.566</b><br>most of these coins are coins I want to own so<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.800 - 00:03:07.966</b><br>you know I bought bought<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.966 - 00:03:11.066</b><br>bought and then sold and made a nice chunk of profit<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.066 - 00:03:12.133</b><br>but at the same time<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.133 - 00:03:15.366</b><br>and look at the profit like we're looking at like 10 5<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.466 - 00:03:16.866</b><br>all the way back up to 13<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.933 - 00:03:19.166</b><br>so 30 percent on some of those buys<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.333 - 00:03:23.566</b><br>then you know I waited for it to crack and it just<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.733 - 00:03:26.366</b><br>I was calling this the the the base<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.366 - 00:03:28.600</b><br>so I just got a nibble right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.133 - 00:03:30.533</b><br>and then I got a beautiful bounce<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.533 - 00:03:32.900</b><br>off of that so I sold right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.200 - 00:03:34.366</b><br>so there's your new base<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.366 - 00:03:36.533</b><br>and then here I just got in just now<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.533 - 00:03:38.500</b><br>and you can see I have an order just under<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.700 - 00:03:40.166</b><br>where I got in I got an 87<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.166 - 00:03:42.333</b><br>I'm gonna try to get 8's I'm gonna try to get probably<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.500 - 00:03:44.666</b><br>7s and 6s if it wants to keep going down<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.300 - 00:03:48.900</b><br>but see this is this is trading completely normal<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.000 - 00:03:52.300</b><br>even though the market is crashing it's trading normal<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.733 - 00:03:53.666</b><br>amp on the other<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.200 - 00:03:55.533</b><br>side of the coin<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.600 - 00:03:59.133</b><br>is really getting hit hard<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.166 - 00:03:59.466</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.466 - 00:04:02.300</b><br>that means I'm going to get a monster bounce on this<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.300 - 00:04:03.600</b><br>coming up into the future<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.366 - 00:04:05.733</b><br>anyway I'm just going to leave you guys with that<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.733 - 00:04:07.300</b><br>I just wanted to make a quick update<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.000 - 00:04:10.500</b><br>you know everywhere the market is going down<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.500 - 00:04:11.866</b><br>the theorem is going down<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.466 - 00:04:13.966</b><br>even bitcoins going down<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.266 - 00:04:17.400</b><br>not as much but a lot of these other coins<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.400 - 00:04:19.933</b><br>and because the theorem is going down<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.366 - 00:04:22.066</b><br>other coins that are<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.333 - 00:04:25.800</b><br>platforms like that like Strat and UBIC<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.866 - 00:04:26.766</b><br>and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.766 - 00:04:29.066</b><br>those ones are all falling because of theorems falling<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.500 - 00:04:30.933</b><br>but the whole market is going down right now<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.933 - 00:04:31.733</b><br>which is great<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.733 - 00:04:33.300</b><br>which is really great<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.400 - 00:04:34.800</b><br>for me because<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.366 - 00:04:37.166</b><br>sitting mainly in cash<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.200 - 00:04:40.600</b><br>I'm able to start buying up all of these little coins<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.400 - 00:04:42.466</b><br>you know as they go<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.466 - 00:04:44.100</b><br>and making these beautiful beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.100 - 00:04:45.566</b><br>trades on all these bounces<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.766 - 00:04:47.100</b><br>anyway I gotta go back to work<br></p></body></html>
