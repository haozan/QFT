00:00:05.400</b><br>I'm not making very many trades right now<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.400 - 00:00:07.133</b><br>so I thought I'd make a quick video<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.133 - 00:00:10.133</b><br>especially since Bitcoin is at its all time high<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.266 - 00:00:11.900</b><br>look at this 4418<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.933 - 00:00:14.900</b><br>and the all time high is like 4450 or something<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.666 - 00:00:17.000</b><br>so we are at all time high<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.000 - 00:00:19.466</b><br>we're about to break out possibly right<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.466 - 00:00:20.966</b><br>and this is where everybody<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.266 - 00:00:23.600</b><br>look 44 30 this is where<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.600 - 00:00:27.333</b><br>everybody gets excited and makes the wrong moves<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.333 - 00:00:29.166</b><br>and this is where all the breakout<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.166 - 00:00:32.000</b><br>traders are waiting for that little spike pass 4500<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.000 - 00:00:33.133</b><br>to try to get in<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.366 - 00:00:34.166</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.000 - 00:00:36.100</b><br>how do you deal with this<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.100 - 00:00:37.666</b><br>and how does Luke think about this<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.666 - 00:00:41.966</b><br>and let's get some context on this market so we know<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.966 - 00:00:43.533</b><br>kind of what's going to happen next<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.533 - 00:00:44.400</b><br>or we can make<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.933 - 00:00:46.766</b><br>some probabilities<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.500 - 00:00:49.933</b><br>okay so you're at all time high<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.333 - 00:00:51.166</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.333 - 00:00:54.533</b><br>the only way<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.666 - 00:00:56.766</b><br>to understand what the crowd does<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.766 - 00:00:59.300</b><br>how Bitcoin reacts to all time highs<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.300 - 00:01:01.700</b><br>is to look in the past at all time highs<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.700 - 00:01:02.966</b><br>now the first thing you got to think<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.966 - 00:01:05.466</b><br>about is where is the psychological level here<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.900 - 00:01:08.100</b><br>so the psychological level is 5000<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.366 - 00:01:10.166</b><br>right that's just obvious<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.466 - 00:01:14.166</b><br>5000 is like a big number and hard to break through<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.366 - 00:01:16.766</b><br>and if we break through 5000<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.933 - 00:01:19.466</b><br>this could really really go crazy<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.466 - 00:01:21.066</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.066 - 00:01:23.200</b><br>what was the last psychological number<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.333 - 00:01:26.166</b><br>like what how could we look in the past and see how<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.166 - 00:01:28.533</b><br>bitcoin reacts to these psychological numbers<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.666 - 00:01:31.333</b><br>well the last number was 3000 in my opinion<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.366 - 00:01:33.566</b><br>so if we scroll back to 3000<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.900 - 00:01:35.700</b><br>back here<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.866 - 00:01:38.566</b><br>we'll see that 29<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.000 - 00:01:43.133</b><br>was really hard to pass because it was so close to 3000<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.400 - 00:01:46.200</b><br>so if you remember we got this dip down to 1800<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.200 - 00:01:47.900</b><br>and then we got this crazy<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.900 - 00:01:50.166</b><br>crazy jump all the way up to<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.266 - 00:01:53.333</b><br>29 so 60 percent from 18 to 9<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.333 - 00:01:57.000</b><br>and then you know came up to 29 had a hard time<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.500 - 00:01:58.966</b><br>came back down to 26<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.966 - 00:02:00.866</b><br>came up to 29 had a hard time<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.133 - 00:02:02.866</b><br>came back down to 24<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.666 - 00:02:06.500</b><br>came back up had a hard time came back down<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.500 - 00:02:08.766</b><br>came back up 29 again<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.900 - 00:02:09.800</b><br>had a hard time<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.366 - 00:02:14.066</b><br>you know like so that 3000 level was so<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.200 - 00:02:15.366</b><br>so strong<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.366 - 00:02:18.300</b><br>or such a big thing for everybody in their mind<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.533 - 00:02:23.300</b><br>that we just kept hitting 29 29 29 29 29 and<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.400 - 00:02:24.600</b><br>finally it breaks out<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.766 - 00:02:26.066</b><br>and when it breaks past that<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.066 - 00:02:28.733</b><br>3000 it doesn't even come back to test it<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.933 - 00:02:31.666</b><br>you know it gets all the way up here to 34<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.966 - 00:02:34.966</b><br>80 or something pulls back to 32<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.333 - 00:02:36.700</b><br>doesn't even get close to that<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.700 - 00:02:38.766</b><br>3000 and then takes off again<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.166 - 00:02:39.966</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.333 - 00:02:42.200</b><br>that's how we should be looking at this<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.266 - 00:02:45.066</b><br>if this thing breaks out past 5000<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.666 - 00:02:46.200</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.200 - 00:02:50.166</b><br>doesn't come back to even try to test these 4500s<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.500 - 00:02:52.900</b><br>then that is some real strength<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.200 - 00:02:55.966</b><br>but if it does come back to test these 4500<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.966 - 00:02:57.766</b><br>let's say we get a breakout to<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.100 - 00:02:59.766</b><br>50500 or something<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.766 - 00:03:02.800</b><br>and it comes right back down to test these 4500<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.900 - 00:03:04.366</b><br>or even cracks them<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.400 - 00:03:07.966</b><br>you know that's not the same strength as over here<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.966 - 00:03:10.333</b><br>this was some serious strength going on<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.600 - 00:03:15.133</b><br>and that not coming back to test the 3000<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.366 - 00:03:17.766</b><br>tells you there's strength like crazy<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.466 - 00:03:21.933</b><br>and of course there was it went all the way up to 4400<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.966 - 00:03:25.133</b><br>so anyway that's where we are right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.766 - 00:03:27.966</b><br>if we look at my trades so<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.000 - 00:03:28.566</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.566 - 00:03:29.600</b><br>last week<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.300 - 00:03:31.933</b><br>well I don't know like a few days ago<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.566 - 00:03:35.133</b><br>last video basically<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.266 - 00:03:37.333</b><br>I drew a line right here and said you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.333 - 00:03:41.666</b><br>right here at 3800 is my base anything under 3800<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.666 - 00:03:43.066</b><br>I'm going to be looking to buy<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.700 - 00:03:44.966</b><br>I was even hoping that we<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.966 - 00:03:47.300</b><br>would retest 3000 or something like that<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.300 - 00:03:50.300</b><br>you know I'd be able to get into real thick on a trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.400 - 00:03:54.366</b><br>unfortunately all I got was this 36 40 or something<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.100 - 00:03:56.600</b><br>let me just put that on the screen<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.133 - 00:03:58.866</b><br>just show ordered history<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.366 - 00:04:00.733</b><br>so yeah so<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.866 - 00:04:04.133</b><br>I only got a nibble right here at you know 36<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.133 - 00:04:05.466</b><br>I don't know 20 or 36<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.466 - 00:04:06.266</b><br>40 or something<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.000 - 00:04:11.266</b><br>and then I sold 38 and I sold 39s and then of course<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.533 - 00:04:13.200</b><br>when you're when you're here<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.266 - 00:04:16.866</b><br>when you're over here you don't really know<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.100 - 00:04:18.566</b><br>if this thing's going to start to<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.600 - 00:04:20.766</b><br>you know continue down and really do<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.966 - 00:04:23.500</b><br>make a test of those 3000s but<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.500 - 00:04:24.300</b><br>anyway<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.600 - 00:04:27.933</b><br>I got to I was able to sell some<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.933 - 00:04:31.300</b><br>and of course I am not going to sell any more bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.666 - 00:04:32.466</b><br>until<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.166 - 00:04:34.100</b><br>it breaks out<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.200 - 00:04:37.933</b><br>like until I get a clear breakout and I can judge<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.000 - 00:04:40.000</b><br>whether or not it's a good idea to sell<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.000 - 00:04:40.800</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.366 - 00:04:43.500</b><br>so depending on what happens and maybe I'll just<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.500 - 00:04:44.733</b><br>I'll make a quick video later<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.733 - 00:04:47.166</b><br>and update you guys in the next day or two<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.800 - 00:04:50.266</b><br>of whatever happens here and<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.600 - 00:04:53.133</b><br>what I decide to do so I'm still sitting on Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.400 - 00:04:55.200</b><br>obviously<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.066 - 00:04:57.933</b><br>you can see that I've been trading it in and out<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.933 - 00:05:00.600</b><br>just little tiny little nibbles back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.266 - 00:05:03.500</b><br>making a few hundred dollars here and there but<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.066 - 00:05:05.100</b><br>the rest of my<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.266 - 00:05:07.666</b><br>all of my free bitcoin that I'm sitting on<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.200 - 00:05:09.466</b><br>I'm still waiting to see<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.466 - 00:05:11.466</b><br>what happens before I sell off some more<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.600 - 00:05:14.733</b><br>so I'm always being asked on my vlog<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.366 - 00:05:18.166</b><br>to talk about account building traits the small<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.166 - 00:05:18.866</b><br>account building<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.866 - 00:05:21.500</b><br>traits where you take small positions and you make big<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.400 - 00:05:24.133</b><br>percentages on those positions<br></p><p><b>00:05:24.966 - 00:05:25.666</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.666 - 00:05:27.200</b><br>there's one that I've been trading the past few days<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.200 - 00:05:28.933</b><br>so I thought I'd show you that one<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.366 - 00:05:32.100</b><br>just to talk to you about the mentality and<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.266 - 00:05:33.066</b><br>really<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.500 - 00:05:34.700</b><br>what you're looking for<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.466 - 00:05:36.700</b><br>with these tinier trades<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.700 - 00:05:38.500</b><br>you can't take size on these though<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.200 - 00:05:41.366</b><br>so I've been trading this Bas<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.566 - 00:05:42.366</b><br>ether<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.466 - 00:05:43.466</b><br>bass ether<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.466 - 00:05:45.100</b><br>and I actually did a little bit of research on it<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.100 - 00:05:46.766</b><br>because I like the price action<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.333 - 00:05:49.000</b><br>this only got listed a few days ago<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.000 - 00:05:49.800</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.600 - 00:05:52.900</b><br>maybe about three weeks ago or something it got listed<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.900 - 00:05:53.700</b><br>on<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.500 - 00:05:56.200</b><br>hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.200 - 00:05:58.200</b><br>and so you can't actually see my<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.200 - 00:06:00.066</b><br>traits because it got listed on hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.066 - 00:06:01.933</b><br>and hitbit doesn't work with<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.366 - 00:06:03.333</b><br>konigi very good<br></p><p><b>00:06:03.666 - 00:06:05.400</b><br>but or coinage<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.400 - 00:06:07.400</b><br>I guess I should be calling them by their real name<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.333 - 00:06:10.266</b><br>but anyway I liked this price action<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.266 - 00:06:11.766</b><br>I saw how it was running up<br></p><p><b>00:06:11.766 - 00:06:12.266</b><br>how there's<br></p><p><b>00:06:12.266 - 00:06:14.900</b><br>obviously buyers coming into the market over here<br></p><p><b>00:06:15.333 - 00:06:17.766</b><br>you know it's new on the exchange and<br></p><p><b>00:06:18.933 - 00:06:21.100</b><br>the volumes start to pick up and<br></p><p><b>00:06:21.400 - 00:06:23.166</b><br>there seem to be a lot of attention to it<br></p><p><b>00:06:23.166 - 00:06:24.866</b><br>so I actually just went and looked it up<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.866 - 00:06:26.666</b><br>and it's like this Asian coin<br></p><p><b>00:06:27.166 - 00:06:28.300</b><br>they're trying to get<br></p><p><b>00:06:28.533 - 00:06:30.800</b><br>coin just to use in restaurants and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:06:31.333 - 00:06:33.200</b><br>the supply is very small<br></p><p><b>00:06:33.800 - 00:06:35.733</b><br>right here it's only got a 5000<br></p><p><b>00:06:36.266 - 00:06:39.866</b><br>supply it's only got a market cap of $1 million<br></p><p><b>00:06:39.866 - 00:06:41.933</b><br>so it's really really tiny<br></p><p><b>00:06:43.966 - 00:06:46.766</b><br>so anyway I started watching to see how<br></p><p><b>00:06:47.500 - 00:06:49.266</b><br>how it does with every little dip<br></p><p><b>00:06:49.266 - 00:06:51.300</b><br>you know does every little dip get bought up<br></p><p><b>00:06:51.300 - 00:06:53.800</b><br>and it seemed like with all of this price action<br></p><p><b>00:06:53.800 - 00:06:54.600</b><br>with all of<br></p><p><b>00:06:54.866 - 00:06:55.800</b><br>the buying that<br></p><p><b>00:06:56.000 - 00:06:57.600</b><br>all these little dips were getting bought up<br></p><p><b>00:06:57.600 - 00:06:59.400</b><br>and the percentages are high<br></p><p><b>00:06:59.466 - 00:07:01.566</b><br>you know so like when you get a dip to<br></p><p><b>00:07:01.700 - 00:07:02.800</b><br>you know to six<br></p><p><b>00:07:02.900 - 00:07:04.366</b><br>you get a bounce to 10<br></p><p><b>00:07:04.700 - 00:07:07.300</b><br>you know and then when you get a dip down to three<br></p><p><b>00:07:07.733 - 00:07:09.800</b><br>you get a bounce all the way up to seven<br></p><p><b>00:07:09.800 - 00:07:12.366</b><br>so it's almost like you can double your money<br></p><p><b>00:07:12.366 - 00:07:13.766</b><br>or very close to<br></p><p><b>00:07:13.766 - 00:07:15.133</b><br>on all these dips<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.733 - 00:07:18.366</b><br>so because it's a small point<br></p><p><b>00:07:18.533 - 00:07:20.066</b><br>because there's not<br></p><p><b>00:07:20.066 - 00:07:22.300</b><br>like there's some volume there and you can take<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.400 - 00:07:24.800</b><br>some decent size but because<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.066 - 00:07:27.400</b><br>of what it is you can't take big size right<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.400 - 00:07:28.200</b><br>you can't go big<br></p><p><b>00:07:28.200 - 00:07:30.566</b><br>so you might be able to get two or three etherium<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.666 - 00:07:32.300</b><br>in each debt and make an<br></p><p><b>00:07:32.300 - 00:07:33.933</b><br>etherium or two you know make three<br></p><p><b>00:07:33.933 - 00:07:35.333</b><br>four or 500 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:07:35.533 - 00:07:38.100</b><br>every dip and that's basically what I was doing<br></p><p><b>00:07:38.100 - 00:07:40.133</b><br>so it's really easy to<br></p><p><b>00:07:41.466 - 00:07:44.466</b><br>you know to say I'm going to buy anything under<br></p><p><b>00:07:44.933 - 00:07:46.500</b><br>you know 83<br></p><p><b>00:07:46.700 - 00:07:48.200</b><br>and then that gets you in over here<br></p><p><b>00:07:48.200 - 00:07:50.400</b><br>and then I'm going to buy anything under six<br></p><p><b>00:07:50.666 - 00:07:53.200</b><br>and that gets you over here and last night I got<br></p><p><b>00:07:53.200 - 00:07:55.566</b><br>such a beautiful trade or yesterday I guess<br></p><p><b>00:07:55.700 - 00:07:58.933</b><br>I got a beautiful trade I picked up 20s I got<br></p><p><b>00:07:59.133 - 00:08:00.466</b><br>20s right here<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.466 - 00:08:03.300</b><br>you know so I was looking for anything under 37<br></p><p><b>00:08:03.533 - 00:08:04.266</b><br>and I got<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.266 - 00:08:08.800</b><br>20s and I did not get 15s but it actually went to 15s<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.466 - 00:08:11.100</b><br>and then this morning it<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.100 - 00:08:13.766</b><br>just jumped just now up back up to 10<br></p><p><b>00:08:14.200 - 00:08:18.733</b><br>so 15 to 10 is what is that<br></p><p><b>00:08:18.733 - 00:08:19.600</b><br>that's like<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.366 - 00:08:21.933</b><br>seven times your money<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.666 - 00:08:25.666</b><br>those are big big big jumps<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.866 - 00:08:28.333</b><br>maybe six times your money I don't know but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:08:28.400 - 00:08:30.100</b><br>those are really big jumps<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.766 - 00:08:33.700</b><br>so anyway I bought the twos I think I sold the fours<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.166 - 00:08:35.800</b><br>so I doubled my money again<br></p><p><b>00:08:35.966 - 00:08:36.766</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:08:36.866 - 00:08:38.866</b><br>here's an opportunity to make<br></p><p><b>00:08:39.266 - 00:08:40.066</b><br>a few<br></p><p><b>00:08:40.133 - 00:08:43.566</b><br>Ethereum coins over and over and over and over again<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.600 - 00:08:45.166</b><br>and you can't ever get big<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.166 - 00:08:48.100</b><br>so it's not like I buy two Ethereum here<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.133 - 00:08:48.933</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.466 - 00:08:51.266</b><br>I make an extra ethere<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.266 - 00:08:51.666</b><br>and a half<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.666 - 00:08:53.600</b><br>and then I put all of that on the next trade<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.600 - 00:08:54.666</b><br>I don't do that<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.766 - 00:08:56.600</b><br>I just buy two Ethereum here<br></p><p><b>00:08:56.600 - 00:08:58.666</b><br>and I make a really good percentage<br></p><p><b>00:08:58.733 - 00:09:01.533</b><br>and I buy two Ethereum here and I make a really good<br></p><p><b>00:09:01.566 - 00:09:05.166</b><br>percentage and by the time I buy two Ethereum here<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.400 - 00:09:07.733</b><br>I'm already playing with money I've made<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.733 - 00:09:10.100</b><br>off of the past two trades<br></p><p><b>00:09:10.100 - 00:09:12.733</b><br>and that's what I mean about a small account building<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.900 - 00:09:13.566</b><br>thing<br></p><p><b>00:09:13.566 - 00:09:16.766</b><br>you got to look at the risk and you got to realize<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.866 - 00:09:19.666</b><br>that there's not much volume you know like<br></p><p><b>00:09:19.900 - 00:09:21.700</b><br>it's decent but there's not<br></p><p><b>00:09:21.800 - 00:09:23.400</b><br>enough to be starting to take<br></p><p><b>00:09:23.400 - 00:09:26.066</b><br>real size you're not going to buy 10 Ethereum coin<br></p><p><b>00:09:27.366 - 00:09:28.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:09:28.066 - 00:09:30.333</b><br>you just keep on trading the little bit that you<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.333 - 00:09:32.600</b><br>initially you gauge<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.800 - 00:09:34.333</b><br>what you think you can add<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.333 - 00:09:36.733</b><br>what you think you can put as an order and I<br></p><p><b>00:09:37.000 - 00:09:39.100</b><br>gauge it at about 2 Ethereum coin<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.300 - 00:09:40.566</b><br>so you gauge that<br></p><p><b>00:09:40.566 - 00:09:42.966</b><br>and you stick to that the whole way along<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.100 - 00:09:43.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.066 - 00:09:46.366</b><br>but it's still really good money<br></p><p><b>00:09:46.366 - 00:09:48.100</b><br>and if you have a small account<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.666 - 00:09:50.700</b><br>that allows you to build a small account<br></p><p><b>00:09:50.700 - 00:09:51.933</b><br>really really fast<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.933 - 00:09:54.333</b><br>like if your account is only $1,000<br></p><p><b>00:09:54.566 - 00:09:56.733</b><br>and you're going to you're going to spend<br></p><p><b>00:09:57.133 - 00:09:58.900</b><br>you know if your account is only $1,000<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.900 - 00:10:00.500</b><br>I would only buy one a theorem coin<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.500 - 00:10:01.700</b><br>you know I wouldn't go in<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.933 - 00:10:04.700</b><br>very big but one a theorem coin is $300<br></p><p><b>00:10:04.700 - 00:10:07.100</b><br>and right here you would have made about 150<br></p><p><b>00:10:07.400 - 00:10:09.766</b><br>and then right here maybe you make the whole<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.866 - 00:10:10.933</b><br>300 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:10:10.933 - 00:10:13.400</b><br>and then right here you definitely make another 300<br></p><p><b>00:10:13.466 - 00:10:15.000</b><br>maybe not even a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.600 - 00:10:18.566</b><br>and you've already doubled your thousand dollar account<br></p><p><b>00:10:18.800 - 00:10:20.766</b><br>you've only risked 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:10:21.133 - 00:10:22.666</b><br>but you've already doubled the entire<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.666 - 00:10:24.333</b><br>thousand dollar account by the time you get to<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.333 - 00:10:25.133</b><br>over here<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.800 - 00:10:27.266</b><br>so you see how fast<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.266 - 00:10:28.966</b><br>within a few days<br></p><p><b>00:10:29.066 - 00:10:31.666</b><br>you've built up that thousand dollars to 2000<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.766 - 00:10:34.000</b><br>meanwhile not taking extra risk<br></p><p><b>00:10:34.400 - 00:10:36.500</b><br>so you have to weigh those two things<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.500 - 00:10:38.166</b><br>your wrists versus reward<br></p><p><b>00:10:38.333 -
