00:00:04.866</b><br>I just came back from a very long drive<br></p><p><b>00:00:04.866 - 00:00:06.466</b><br>it's Saturday afternoon right now<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.966 - 00:00:09.933</b><br>so 4 hours each direction to buy that<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.133 - 00:00:11.533</b><br>juice press back there<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.866 - 00:00:13.533</b><br>so if you don't know what a juice press is<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.966 - 00:00:15.266</b><br>you might have seen in other videos<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.266 - 00:00:16.466</b><br>that I like to juice<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.466 - 00:00:18.500</b><br>and try to stay healthy and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.133 - 00:00:23.366</b><br>but I use like the Breville Juicer or the Mega Juicer<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.733 - 00:00:24.533</b><br>some of those<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.300 - 00:00:27.866</b><br>kind of cool juicers that make juice really fast<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.866 - 00:00:30.300</b><br>but they're you know one's a masocating<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.300 - 00:00:32.733</b><br>slow auger masocating juicer and one's a<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.133 - 00:00:37.133</b><br>centrifuse juicer and that is the oldest type of juicer<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.133 - 00:00:39.900</b><br>that's one of those juicers where<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.900 - 00:00:42.000</b><br>back in the old days they used to just cut up<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.000 - 00:00:43.933</b><br>before they maybe even had electricity<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.166 - 00:00:44.533</b><br>they used to<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.533 - 00:00:46.466</b><br>cut up their vegetables and they put them in this press<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.466 - 00:00:47.866</b><br>and the press would squeeze<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.900 - 00:00:50.333</b><br>and thousands of pounds of pressure and<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.333 - 00:00:51.400</b><br>squeeze out the juice<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.300 - 00:00:53.166</b><br>so that's what that is<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.166 - 00:00:55.800</b><br>it's got like a little hand pump and you pump it up<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.966 - 00:00:58.600</b><br>and I just spent the past two hours washing it up<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.600 - 00:01:00.200</b><br>really good because it's old and<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.666 - 00:01:01.966</b><br>still in really awesome shape<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.966 - 00:01:03.866</b><br>and all of it is stainless steel<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.866 - 00:01:04.933</b><br>so that's really great<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.566 - 00:01:08.666</b><br>anyway this video is not about juicing<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.900 - 00:01:11.000</b><br>I wanted to discuss with you guys real quick<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.733 - 00:01:12.766</b><br>two of the most<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.766 - 00:01:15.600</b><br>common questions I get when Bitcoin is racing<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.600 - 00:01:16.933</b><br>to all new highs<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.400 - 00:01:20.300</b><br>every time that Bitcoin just takes off out of the gate<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.666 - 00:01:23.766</b><br>I keep getting these same two questions from mainly new<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.266 - 00:01:27.566</b><br>traders like people who are new to trading my method<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.466 - 00:01:31.733</b><br>and maybe you know I didn't explain this method<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.933 - 00:01:32.666</b><br>well enough<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.666 - 00:01:35.966</b><br>or how this works for those questions to be answered<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.533 - 00:01:38.366</b><br>and I'm sure they're answered in the chat room<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.366 - 00:01:40.533</b><br>I didn't really go to look to see if they like<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.533 - 00:01:41.500</b><br>I just keep getting these<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.500 - 00:01:43.733</b><br>questions from the traders individually<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.133 - 00:01:45.500</b><br>so I thought I'd readdress them<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.000 - 00:01:47.666</b><br>so the first question is<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.733 - 00:01:49.266</b><br>does Luke's method work<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.266 - 00:01:51.366</b><br>when the stock is just running up and up and up<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.800 - 00:01:54.666</b><br>I get this all the time and every time the coins<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.733 - 00:01:58.266</b><br>starts taking off then that's the question I get<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.933 - 00:02:01.200</b><br>well we never break a base<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.200 - 00:02:04.066</b><br>so how in the world do we get any of these coins<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.533 - 00:02:06.500</b><br>to be able to sell them at highs<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.566 - 00:02:08.566</b><br>so if you look at this chart right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.766 - 00:02:11.600</b><br>you can see that I sold some at 44<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.700 - 00:02:13.100</b><br>we're at 58<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.533 - 00:02:14.766</b><br>I sold some at 44<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.333 - 00:02:19.733</b><br>and I sold some at 48 and I sold some at 52<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.100 - 00:02:21.566</b><br>and 52 50<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.566 - 00:02:25.133</b><br>5450 and 5550<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.966 - 00:02:28.000</b><br>so all I'm doing right now is selling selling<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.000 - 00:02:30.300</b><br>selling selling selling and<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.000 - 00:02:33.000</b><br>well the new<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.000 - 00:02:34.333</b><br>people should be asking themselves<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.333 - 00:02:36.933</b><br>where is Luke getting the coins to sell<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.600 - 00:02:38.400</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.700 - 00:02:39.900</b><br>is my method working<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.900 - 00:02:40.666</b><br>well I'm<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.666 - 00:02:43.600</b><br>profiting and profiting and profiting and profiting<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.600 - 00:02:47.933</b><br>and why am I why am I selling at 48 if we're at 58<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.800 - 00:02:50.066</b><br>can't foretell the future<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.166 - 00:02:50.966</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.766 - 00:02:53.600</b><br>every time I get that feeling<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.800 - 00:02:54.866</b><br>where I'm like<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.866 - 00:02:56.466</b><br>oh man this is getting ridiculous<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.466 - 00:02:58.133</b><br>and if you scroll back a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.600 - 00:03:00.200</b><br>you know right here I was like<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.200 - 00:03:01.733</b><br>oh man this is getting ridiculous<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.733 - 00:03:05.500</b><br>we just went from 41 to 47<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.500 - 00:03:07.700</b><br>so of course I'm going to sell a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.900 - 00:03:09.166</b><br>you know it's getting ridiculous<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.166 - 00:03:10.066</b><br>and then all of a sudden it<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.066 - 00:03:12.000</b><br>pops up all the way past 50<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.266 - 00:03:17.600</b><br>52 54 56 you know it's getting ridiculous<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.600 - 00:03:18.666</b><br>and that's where we are right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.666 - 00:03:19.466</b><br></p><p><b>00:03:19.900 - 00:03:21.733</b><br>but anyway every time I get that feeling<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.966 - 00:03:23.866</b><br>I'm like oh I'm just gonna<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.133 - 00:03:27.866</b><br>let go of 30 percent of the coins I'm holding<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.966 - 00:03:30.000</b><br>the coins that I<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.066 - 00:03:31.333</b><br>made down<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.333 - 00:03:33.733</b><br>here in all these UPS and downs and UPS and downs<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.733 - 00:03:34.300</b><br>and UPS and downs<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.300 - 00:03:35.500</b><br>and it looks crazy<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.500 - 00:03:36.866</b><br>all of this looks crazy<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.300 - 00:03:39.766</b><br>you know because you got green arrows like<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.766 - 00:03:42.200</b><br>nuts here and you got red arrows like nuts<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.200 - 00:03:44.500</b><br>but if you scroll into those arrows<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.933 - 00:03:46.366</b><br>whoo way down<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.133 -

00:04:05.966</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.333 - 00:04:07.966</b><br>when we get to where we are now<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.800 - 00:04:10.000</b><br>I'm able to<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.366 - 00:04:13.533</b><br>sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.900 - 00:04:18.666</b><br>I wish that I could foretell the future<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.666 - 00:04:22.166</b><br>like I wish that you know at 47<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.766 - 00:04:23.566</b><br></p><p><b>00:04:24.200 - 00:04:25.700</b><br>I knew that we were going to 58<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.700 - 00:04:27.566</b><br>because then I just wouldn't have sold some here<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.566 - 00:04:28.966</b><br>and I wouldn't have sold some here but<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.133 - 00:04:31.066</b><br>just you don't know this<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.200 - 00:04:33.766</b><br>the only thing I can tell you for sure<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.366 - 00:04:35.166</b><br>is that<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.700 - 00:04:37.733</b><br>when we crack real bases<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.900 - 00:04:40.700</b><br>on Bitcoin or Ethereum or<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.766 - 00:04:43.066</b><br>you know Neo or any major coin<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.166 - 00:04:44.866</b><br>when we crack a base<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.066 - 00:04:47.366</b><br>that is the safest and highest<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.366 - 00:04:50.933</b><br>odd place to buy is in the panic off of that base<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.200 - 00:04:53.533</b><br>you know and that panic all the way down to 30<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.800 - 00:04:55.333</b><br>was amazing<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.333 - 00:04:56.133</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.966 - 00:04:58.300</b><br>if you would have bought anything under<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.300 - 00:04:59.966</b><br>36 was the base at that time<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.166 - 00:05:02.933</b><br>oh my goodness right so<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.366 - 00:05:05.800</b><br>those are your high probability trades<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.800 - 00:05:08.100</b><br>if you buy right now at 58<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.166 - 00:05:11.666</b><br>let's say and it goes all the way to 65<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.300 - 00:05:16.000</b><br>you will be rewarded for learning the wrong<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.066 - 00:05:16.866</b><br>thing<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.500 - 00:05:20.133</b><br>and that's the worst possible thing that can happen<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.133 - 00:05:23.400</b><br>to you you buy it 58 and it goes to 65<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.733 - 00:05:28.166</b><br>and you're like Yay I win I win and<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.266 - 00:05:31.500</b><br>you just got rewarded for doing the wrong thing<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.300 - 00:05:35.100</b><br>the very next coin that you buy that's taking off like<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.100 - 00:05:36.333</b><br>crazy and you think oh<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.333 - 00:05:37.333</b><br>I'm gonna do that<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.333 - 00:05:39.400</b><br>same thing I did with bitcoin last time<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.700 - 00:05:41.766</b><br>you're gonna get burned<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.800 - 00:05:44.800</b><br>and you're gonna get burned really hard and be like<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.800 - 00:05:45.966</b><br>what the world<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.966 - 00:05:47.800</b><br>why you know why is this happening to me<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.800 - 00:05:48.933</b><br>the world is falling<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.400 - 00:05:50.900</b><br>you don't want to get rewarded<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.900 - 00:05:52.166</b><br>for doing the wrong thing<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.900 - 00:05:55.600</b><br>so you have to know your probabilities<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.600 - 00:05:58.200</b><br>you have to know your odds before you take a trade<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.266 - 00:06:00.933</b><br>and the odds up here of this going from<br></p><p><b>00:06:01.533 - 00:06:04.400</b><br>58 to 65 are low<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.300 - 00:06:06.466</b><br>they're very low<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.866 - 00:06:09.100</b><br>so that's not the odds you want to take<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.566 - 00:06:10.800</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.800 - 00:06:12.733</b><br>so the other question that I get most often<br></p><p><b>00:06:12.733 - 00:06:14.700</b><br>when Bitcoin just takes off to the moon<br></p><p><b>00:06:15.333 - 00:06:17.900</b><br>bitcoin tends to affect the alt coins<br></p><p><b>00:06:17.900 - 00:06:20.566</b><br>so I'll get a question from new traders usually<br></p><p><b>00:06:20.733 - 00:06:22.733</b><br>who are just not really familiar with my method<br></p><p><b>00:06:22.733 - 00:06:23.533</b><br>very good yet<br></p><p><b>00:06:23.966 - 00:06:26.366</b><br>and they'll ask me and I get these<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.933 - 00:06:27.933</b><br>as private messages<br></p><p><b>00:06:27.933 - 00:06:30.200</b><br>so it just I just get tons of these messages<br></p><p><b>00:06:30.933 - 00:06:32.066</b><br>they'll ask me Luke<br></p><p><b>00:06:32.066 - 00:06:34.700</b><br>I got into this trade I saw the base<br></p><p><b>00:06:35.133 - 00:06:37.133</b><br>you know this all trade I saw the base<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.733 - 00:06:40.400</b><br>it clearly broke the base and there was a panic<br></p><p><b>00:06:40.600 - 00:06:43.533</b><br>and I got in and it kept falling<br></p><p><b>00:06:44.066 - 00:06:47.966</b><br>and now it never bounced back to its base what do I do<br></p><p><b>00:06:48.066 - 00:06:50.600</b><br>like do I sell out a loss<br></p><p><b>00:06:51.000 - 00:06:53.166</b><br>do I wait for it to break even<br></p><p><b>00:06:53.733 - 00:06:54.866</b><br>do I wait for the base<br></p><p><b>00:06:54.866 - 00:06:57.400</b><br>which could take a week or two or who knows how long<br></p><p><b>00:06:57.400 - 00:06:59.966</b><br>or maybe never go back to the base because it<br></p><p><b>00:07:00.066 - 00:07:01.500</b><br>is an alt coin right<br></p><p><b>00:07:01.500 - 00:07:03.300</b><br>so it's a little riskier<br></p><p><b>00:07:03.766 - 00:07:05.200</b><br>it's not as well supported<br></p><p><b>00:07:05.200 - 00:07:08.000</b><br>and it's being affected by some of these major coins<br></p><p><b>00:07:08.666 - 00:07:09.800</b><br>so what do they do<br></p><p><b>00:07:10.366 - 00:07:11.566</b><br>well here's the thing<br></p><p><b>00:07:11.966 - 00:07:15.333</b><br>it's almost impossible to lose on any trade<br></p><p><b>00:07:17.500 - 00:07:20.733</b><br>it's almost impossible to lose on any<br></p><p><b>00:07:20.766 - 00:07:22.866</b><br>trade when you're trading my method<br></p><p><b>00:07:23.533 - 00:07:25.700</b><br>I don't know if I can say that<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.700 - 00:07:27.300</b><br>slower to make it more clear<br></p><p><b>00:07:28.500 - 00:07:30.500</b><br>your odds of losing<br></p><p><b>00:07:33.733 - 00:07:36.000</b><br>but you have to have the right mentality<br></p><p><b>00:07:36.700 - 00:07:39.133</b><br>you have to layer into your traits<br></p><p><b>00:07:39.300 - 00:07:43.500</b><br>so your very first trade this is the way I think this<br></p><p><b>00:07:43.800 - 00:07:46.366</b><br>is my mentality on trading and this has to be yours<br></p><p><b>00:07:46.500 -

00:07:54.700</b><br>please go lower<br></p><p><b>00:07:55.300 - 00:07:58.466</b><br>you can't be thinking you're happy you found a<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.466 - 00:07:59.333</b><br>you know you found<br></p><p><b>00:07:59.933 - 00:08:01.066</b><br>a panic and that's great<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.066 - 00:08:03.566</b><br>and you waited like 10 percent or 15 percent<br></p><p><b>00:08:03.566 - 00:08:05.000</b><br>you got in at a great place<br></p><p><b>00:08:05.700 - 00:08:07.133</b><br>but you have to be thinking<br></p><p><b>00:08:07.133 - 00:08:08.666</b><br>oh man I'm happy I got some<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.666 - 00:08:10.400</b><br>but I sure hope I can get more<br></p><p><b>00:08:10.800 - 00:08:11.800</b><br>please go lower<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.800 - 00:08:12.933</b><br>please go lower<br></p><p><b>00:08:13.500 - 00:08:16.466</b><br>and then if it goes lower you're like oh please go more<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.200 - 00:08:19.266</b><br>like that has to be your mentality<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.266 - 00:08:20.300</b><br>it cannot be<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.300 - 00:08:22.600</b><br>I hope this bounces so I can make a profit<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.666 - 00:08:23.966</b><br>that's the wrong mentality<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.133 - 00:08:25.800</b><br>so let's say the base was 30<br></p><p><b>00:08:26.466 - 00:08:28.933</b><br>right you're about to trade this alt coin basister<br></p><p><b>00:08:29.266 - 00:08:30.900</b><br>it drops down to 25<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.900 - 00:08:31.733</b><br>you get in<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.800 - 00:08:33.866</b><br>you're like oh man that was a great drop<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.866 - 00:08:35.533</b><br>I got in at a great place<br></p><p><b>00:08:35.766 - 00:08:37.966</b><br>that's a steel you buy two coins<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.000 - 00:08:40.133</b><br>so it's at 25 you buy two coins<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.766 - 00:08:44.100</b><br>then it keeps dropping and you're like yeah<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.400 - 00:08:45.200</b><br>Whoo<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.300 - 00:08:46.766</b><br>it gets all the way down to 20<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.066 - 00:08:48.600</b><br>you buy 4 coins<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.600 - 00:08:50.100</b><br>so now your average is something like<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.100 - 00:08:51.400</b><br>2150 or something<br></p><p><b>00:08:52.500 - 00:08:53.400</b><br>remember you're<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.400 - 00:08:55.800</b><br>calculating these averages it's going further<br></p><p><b>00:08:55.800 - 00:08:57.500</b><br>you're like please drop some more<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.533 - 00:09:00.100</b><br>it drops to 16 yeah<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.533 - 00:09:02.100</b><br>you buy 10 coins<br></p><p><b>00:09:02.300 - 00:09:04.933</b><br>so all of a sudden you brought gravage down to 18<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.933 - 00:09:05.733</b><br>or something<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.766 - 00:09:06.766</b><br>and you're at 15<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.533 - 00:09:09.100</b><br>it bounces to 22<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.733 - 00:09:11.500</b><br>okay as it's passing 18<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.500 - 00:09:12.066</b><br>if you're<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.066 - 00:09:15.166</b><br>if you're new to trading if you're a little nervous<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.166 - 00:09:17.133</b><br>as it's passing 18 that's your break even<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.466 - 00:09:19.766</b><br>you're probably gonna sell some because you're like<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.166 - 00:09:20.966</b><br>hey<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.966 - 00:09:22.400</b><br>man that dropped away further than I<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.400 -

00:09:30.000</b><br>okay maybe you'll sell some at 18<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.000 - 00:09:31.300</b><br>maybe you'll sell some at 19<br></p><p><b>00:09:31.300 - 00:09:32.166</b><br>maybe you'll sell some at<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.166 - 00:09:33.700</b><br>20 maybe you'll sell some at 21<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.700 - 00:09:35.100</b><br>maybe you'll sell some at 22<br></p><p><b>00:09:35.800 - 00:09:36.600</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:09:37.700 - 00:09:39.466</b><br>anything that you sell in profit<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.600 - 00:09:42.333</b><br>is a good trade even a break even is a good trade<br></p><p><b>00:09:42.333 - 00:09:44.733</b><br>but anything in profit is a really good trade<br></p><p><b>00:09:44.900 - 00:09:47.100</b><br>so you just killed this<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.366 - 00:09:49.733</b><br>it bounces to 22<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.933 - 00:09:54.366</b><br>and then turns and keeps falling it goes past 15 14 12<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.133 - 00:09:56.266</b><br>10 you know<br></p><p><b>00:09:56.900 - 00:09:58.600</b><br>a really good die from there<br></p><p><b>00:09:59.166 - 00:09:59.966</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.133 - 00:10:02.333</b><br>it only got to 22 it<br></p><p><b>00:10:02.333 - 00:10:04.933</b><br>never managed to make its base back up to 30<br></p><p><b>00:10:05.600 - 00:10:09.266</b><br>but you got profit over that and<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.333 - 00:10:10.133</b><br>you have to<br></p><p><b>00:10:10.133 - 00:10:11.666</b><br>understand that the reason it never got back to<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.666 - 00:10:15.300</b><br>30 is because Bitcoin is racing and affecting the ulse<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.766 - 00:10:17.466</b><br>so unfortunately<br></p><p><b>00:10:18.000 - 00:10:18.933</b><br>once in a while<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.566 - 00:10:22.200</b><br>you won't get a bounce all the way back up to the base<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.200 - 00:10:23.733</b><br>but because you were layering<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.733 - 00:10:26.900</b><br>it was almost impossible to lose the trade<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.300 - 00:10:30.266</b><br>here is the rule that you have to follow<br></p><p><b>00:10:30.966 - 00:10:34.566</b><br>no matter what you do no matter what layering you do<br></p><p><b>00:10:34.666 -

00:10:51.866</b><br>I have to participate in every bounce<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.900 - 00:10:54.133</b><br>so let's take a look at an example<br></p><p><b>00:10:55.566 - 00:10:57.766</b><br>so I just got this exact<br></p><p><b>00:10:58.300 - 00:10:59.066</b><br>question<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.066 - 00:10:59.866</b><br>today<br></p><p><b>00:11:00.066 - 00:11:01.300</b><br>on this on this<br></p><p><b>00:11:02.000 - 00:11:03.700</b><br>coin so ADX<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.766 - 00:11:07.400</b><br>so somebody had seen a 26<br></p><p><b>00:11:07.400 - 00:11:09.800</b><br>2550 or something as a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.133 - 00:11:13.200</b><br>so here's your clear base right clear base<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.100 - 00:11:16.166</b><br>and I don't know where they bought it in but let's say<br></p><p><b>00:11:16.166 - 00:11:18.133</b><br>I don't know if it's 2550<br></p><p><b>00:11:18.133 - 00:11:20.266</b><br>let's say they waited for 22<br></p><p><b>00:11:20.466 - 00:11:22.400</b><br>right so let's say right here they get it 22<br></p><p><b>00:11:23.500 - 00:11:24.300</b><br>all right<br></p><p><b>00:11:25.400 - 00:11:27.866</b><br>it doesn't bounce<br></p><p><b>00:11:27.866 -

00:12:14.166</b><br>so you'd be in profit<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.300 - 00:12:16.700</b><br>then it drops again<br></p><p><b>00:12:17.133 - 00:12:18.366</b><br>and gives you<br></p><p><b>00:12:18.366 -

00:19:37.533</b><br>then you obviously know<br></p><p><b>00:19:37.533 - 00:19:40.133</b><br>that you're going to get some panic eventually<br></p><p><b>00:19:40.400 - 00:19:41.200</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:19:41.933 - 00:19:43.900</b><br>there's a lot of shorts being squeezed<br></p><p><b>00:19:44.166 - 00:19:45.200</b><br>because everybody<br></p><p><b>00:19:45.200 - 00:19:47.133</b><br>when this thing went all the way down to 3000<br></p><p><b>00:19:47.133 - 00:19:48.966</b><br>everybody kind of expected that<br></p><p><b>00:19:48.966 - 00:19:51.133</b><br>there's going to be some more bad news from Russia<br></p><p><b>00:19:51.200 - 00:19:51.766</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:19:51.766 -
