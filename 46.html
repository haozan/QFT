00:00:07.566</b><br>I'm here to start a brand new video series on treating<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.900 - 00:00:08.700</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.966 - 00:00:12.100</b><br>I know a lot of you have followed me in the past and<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.666 - 00:00:13.600</b><br>I had I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.600 - 00:00:16.300</b><br>42 videos or something in my old YouTube channel<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.533 - 00:00:18.566</b><br>which has now been all deleted<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.766 - 00:00:20.166</b><br>there's only a few left on<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.666 - 00:00:21.466</b><br>Kennedy<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.466 - 00:00:25.933</b><br>and I was a little lax in my security back then<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.933 - 00:00:28.400</b><br>I didn't really think that YouTube would be a problem<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.733 - 00:00:33.366</b><br>but anyway I'm a little bit wiser now and<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.533 - 00:00:34.666</b><br>I overreacted<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.666 - 00:00:37.400</b><br>maybe a touch and I deleted all those old videos<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.300 - 00:00:40.666</b><br>so unfortunately you can't go back to see any of those<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.366 - 00:00:44.466</b><br>so that's why I'm starting this brand new video series<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.466 - 00:00:45.266</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.866 - 00:00:46.900</b><br>this is my introduction<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.400 -

00:00:57.133</b><br>I've been trading full time<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.133 - 00:00:59.700</b><br>so I make my money completely 100 percent<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.166 - 00:01:01.300</b><br>in the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.100 -

00:01:14.933</b><br>overwhelming<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.933 - 00:01:18.100</b><br>that when I had the YouTube my old YouTube channel<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.533 - 00:01:19.300</b><br>I just had<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.300 -

00:04:46.400</b><br>and you know if you've been a long time trader<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.466 - 00:04:47.366</b><br>you're gonna be like<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.733 - 00:04:49.600</b><br>this guy must be full of it because<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.900 - 00:04:51.700</b><br>I<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.200 - 00:04:54.166</b><br>I make money on<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.300 - 00:04:55.500</b><br>pretty well every trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.566 - 00:04:56.366</b><br>I mean<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.100 - 00:04:57.966</b><br>I'd say<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.700 - 00:05:00.600</b><br>my success rate is got to be<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.766 - 00:05:02.966</b><br>95 to 98<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.966 - 00:05:04.900</b><br>or something percent on all my<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.900 - 00:05:07.400</b><br>trades I wouldn't even take a trade if I didn't think<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.700 - 00:05:09.566</b><br>that it's guaranteed to winner<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.133 - 00:05:13.066</b><br>so there's a guy that I<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.066 - 00:05:14.300</b><br>well there's three people<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.300 - 00:05:14.933</b><br>that I follow<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.933 - 00:05:16.766</b><br>I really don't follow very many people but<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.900 - 00:05:18.200</b><br>there's a guy on<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.700 - 00:05:21.866</b><br>stocktwitz and his name is trade for a living<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.200 - 00:05:24.600</b><br>and I follow him every day<br></p><p><b>00:05:24.766 - 00:05:25.666</b><br>and I don't<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.666 - 00:05:27.966</b><br>trade what he trades or anything like that I just<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.733 - 00:05:30.966</b><br>because of my experience and<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.300 - 00:05:32.600</b><br>having traded for so long<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.600 - 00:05:34.700</b><br>I look for other people with my mindset<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.700 - 00:05:37.466</b><br>and if I see somebody else that trades like me<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.966 - 00:05:39.200</b><br>then I'll follow them<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.200 - 00:05:40.333</b><br>if they're successful and they<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.333 - 00:05:42.200</b><br>trade like me then I'll follow them because<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.300 - 00:05:43.933</b><br>maybe I'll learn something from them<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.333 - 00:05:47.466</b><br>and it's fun to watch other people succeed<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.000 - 00:05:49.766</b><br>so anyway there's a guy and<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.866 - 00:05:51.966</b><br>I'm just using this as an example for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.966 - 00:05:54.066</b><br>you can't really trade what he trades he's<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.133 - 00:05:56.800</b><br>he trades one stock it's a pharmaceutical stock<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.866 - 00:05:57.800</b><br>and VDA<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.966 - 00:05:59.600</b><br>it's 150 dollar stock<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.133 - 00:06:02.333</b><br>and he's got a two million dollar account<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.500 - 00:06:03.300</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:06:04.500 - 00:06:06.166</b><br>it's out of reach for most of us<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.800 - 00:06:07.600</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.100 - 00:06:11.700</b><br>it's a great example of how your mindset<br></p><p><b>00:06:11.766 -

00:08:46.333</b><br>what what he does is he doubles his account every year<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.533 - 00:08:49.300</b><br>that means he makes $2 million a year<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.600 - 00:08:53.000</b><br>trading one stock and the reason he can do that<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.300 - 00:08:55.300</b><br>is because he got to know<br></p><p><b>00:08:55.700 - 00:08:58.466</b><br>that one stock intimately he spent time<br></p><p><b>00:08:59.133 - 00:09:02.500</b><br>every day watching how that one stock reacts<br></p><p><b>00:09:02.866 -

00:09:12.700</b><br>based on what he's seen<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.766 - 00:09:14.900</b><br>all the way in the chart all along before<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.500 - 00:09:16.300</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.666 - 00:09:19.000</b><br>he likes for that particular stock<br></p><p><b>00:09:19.000 - 00:09:21.100</b><br>that stock likes the head and shoulders pattern<br></p><p><b>00:09:21.100 - 00:09:22.400</b><br>so that often works<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.400 - 00:09:24.100</b><br>and then support resistance<br></p><p><b>00:09:24.100 - 00:09:26.133</b><br>it follows support resistance really good<br></p><p><b>00:09:26.366 - 00:09:28.100</b><br>so he's got those two things<br></p><p><b>00:09:28.133 - 00:09:31.100</b><br>support resistance being the main thing and<br></p><p><b>00:09:31.333 - 00:09:32.800</b><br>he's able to watch for<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.800 - 00:09:34.466</b><br>nice runs to support<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.533 - 00:09:35.900</b><br>and take a bounce off of that<br></p><p><b>00:09:35.900 - 00:09:36.600</b><br>or nice<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.600 - 00:09:39.933</b><br>runs up to resistance and take a short off of that<br></p><p><b>00:09:40.666 - 00:09:44.700</b><br>and he's only looking to make a dollar like one point<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.700 - 00:09:46.500</b><br>on<br></p><p><b>00:09:46.500 - 00:09:49.266</b><br>like one dollar on a hundred and fifty dollar stock<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.266 - 00:09:51.466</b><br>and if he can do that throughout the year<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.866 - 00:09:53.700</b><br>120 * 100 times<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.700 - 00:09:55.333</b><br>hundred and twenty times he doubles his account<br></p><p><b>00:09:57.100 - 00:09:58.733</b><br>so really he sits there all day<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.733 - 00:10:00.400</b><br>he might take three trades a day<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.733 - 00:10:01.766</b><br>he sits there all day just<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.766 -
