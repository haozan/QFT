00:00:07.066</b><br>ran out of stock<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.100 - 00:00:10.533</b><br>and then once he was gone there was no longer a seller<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.700 - 00:00:12.300</b><br>now there's only buyers<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.400 - 00:00:14.566</b><br>now what about the guy who bought all this<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.566 - 00:00:15.866</b><br>all these shares<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.866 - 00:00:19.066</b><br>like let's say Jim bought two<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.166 - 00:00:20.533</b><br>he had a big account<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.333 - 00:00:23.966</b><br>very big account and he bought 235,000<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.966 - 00:00:26.466</b><br>three hundred and sixteen shares off this guy<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.900 - 00:00:29.066</b><br>first off this is usually a market maker<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.066 - 00:00:30.733</b><br>who's made a deal with the seller<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.766 - 00:00:33.666</b><br>and so it's not an actual person named Jim<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.400 - 00:00:36.666</b><br>it's a much larger player<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.666 - 00:00:38.533</b><br>but anyway let's say Jim did<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.666 - 00:00:40.533</b><br>by all of these shares<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.800 - 00:00:41.200</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.200 - 00:00:43.400</b><br>do you think he wants to sell them at<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.400 - 00:00:45.400</b><br>if you bought them at 10<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.400 - 00:00:48.500</b><br>36 do you think he wants to sell them at 10 37<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.933 - 00:00:50.266</b><br>or do you think maybe<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.266 - 00:00:52.366</b><br>he wants to wait for the price to get up to 15<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.466 - 00:00:53.133</b><br>again<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.133 - 00:00:53.733</b><br>see<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.733 - 00:00:55.400</b><br>he's not eager to sell them<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.600 - 00:00:57.333</b><br>the guy the seller<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.900 - 00:01:01.400</b><br>was willing to drop the price from way up here<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.700 - 00:01:05.100</b><br>all the way down to 10 and 9 and 8<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.466 - 00:01:09.300</b><br>he was willing to lose half of the value of his shares<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.300 - 00:01:09.866</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.866 - 00:01:11.700</b><br>maybe he is going through a divorce<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.800 - 00:01:13.466</b><br>and he needs the money right away<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.900 - 00:01:15.866</b><br>maybe he's going into bankruptcy<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.866 - 00:01:17.366</b><br>and he needs the money right away<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.466 - 00:01:18.733</b><br>we don't know why<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.733 - 00:01:19.266</b><br>what has<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.266 - 00:01:22.533</b><br>motivated the seller to lose his money and give<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.533 - 00:01:24.766</b><br>away his shares for half the price<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.900 - 00:01:27.766</b><br>all we know is it was a great deal<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.000 - 00:01:30.166</b><br>and now he's done selling<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.900 - 00:01:33.866</b><br>so that tells me that all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.133 - 00:01:35.566</b><br>the pricing will right back up<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.100 - 00:01:37.666</b><br>this was a beautiful buy<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.533 - 00:01:40.000</b><br>because now<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.866 - 00:01:43.800</b><br>Seller's gone and everybody who picked it up at 10<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.866 - 00:01:46.466</b><br>and 11 and 9<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.100 - 00:01:48.766</b><br>they're not gonna want to sell it right away<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.766 - 00:01:50.366</b><br>they know that the values worth this<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.366 - 00:01:51.666</b><br>so they're just gonna sit on it<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.666 - 00:01:53.900</b><br>it's so easy for them to wait<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.366 - 00:01:56.733</b><br>another day or two and sell it at the top<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.866 - 00:01:58.466</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.466 - 00:02:00.866</b><br>that's basically I'll go so let's take a look<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.866 - 00:02:02.700</b><br>at this in the big market<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.733 - 00:02:04.000</b><br>because this is a very<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.000 - 00:02:06.400</b><br>easy and simple thing to understand<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.400 - 00:02:07.800</b><br>when it's just one seller<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.933 - 00:02:10.933</b><br>but when it's like a whole bunch of sellers<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.000 - 00:02:13.266</b><br>and a great example would be this right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.266 - 00:02:14.500</b><br>ethereum right<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.733 - 00:02:17.333</b><br>on that day that that the Dow<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.366 - 00:02:19.766</b><br>hack happened and everybody panicked<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.933 - 00:02:20.666</b><br>you have this<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.666 - 00:02:20.933</b><br>this<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.933 - 00:02:23.333</b><br>price that just starts falling and falling and falling<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.333 - 00:02:25.666</b><br>and falling and falling and these are one hour bars<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.733 - 00:02:27.733</b><br>so there's an hour there's another hour<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.900 - 00:02:29.333</b><br>so there's three four<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.333 - 00:02:32.366</b><br>five 6 seven eight nine 10 11<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.366 - 00:02:36.866</b><br>12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 hours<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.100 - 00:02:39.000</b><br>by the time it gets to this point<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.066 - 00:02:41.333</b><br>and here's the point where we call<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.533 - 00:02:43.400</b><br>this is called price stuffing<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.933 - 00:02:46.700</b><br>so right here stuffing begins<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.966 - 00:02:48.100</b><br>and you'll see<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.100 - 00:02:48.866</b><br>all this<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.866 - 00:02:51.366</b><br>volume so see over here there's no volume barely<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.366 - 00:02:52.800</b><br>and then all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.133 - 00:02:54.300</b><br>there's all this volume<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.300 - 00:02:57.133</b><br>because there is just a crazy amount of people<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.466 - 00:02:59.533</b><br>wanting to sell now remember<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.733 - 00:03:03.133</b><br>remember what this looked like<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.466 - 00:03:04.466</b><br>very little volume<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.466 - 00:03:05.200</b><br>very little volume<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.200 - 00:03:07.666</b><br>all of a sudden a whole bunch of volume right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.000 - 00:03:10.866</b><br>so same situation right just in the big world<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.266 - 00:03:13.133</b><br>so tons of sellers all<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.133 - 00:03:14.366</b><br>trying to get out of their positions<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.366 - 00:03:15.533</b><br>as fast as they can<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.700 - 00:03:19.333</b><br>and then over here right here for whatever reason<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.333 - 00:03:20.566</b><br>let's not go into<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.800 - 00:03:22.966</b><br>technicals to try to figure this out but<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.166 -

00:03:31.966</b><br>the MEJ or sellers are out of the market at this point<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.200 - 00:03:33.000</b><br>they all<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.000 - 00:03:35.800</b><br>unload it to whoever it is that's willing to buy<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.800 -
