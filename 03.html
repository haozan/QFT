00:00:21.366</b><br>way that they teach you in books<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.466 - 00:00:22.500</b><br>which I don't use<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.000 - 00:00:26.100</b><br>I have my own way of reading support and resistance<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.333 - 00:00:29.166</b><br>but let me just simplify it for you<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.166 - 00:00:30.466</b><br>I'll go through a few<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.466 - 00:00:31.000</b><br>of the different<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.000 - 00:00:33.800</b><br>ideas that people have and the reasons I don't really<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.700 - 00:00:35.866</b><br>go along with that<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.766 - 00:00:40.466</b><br>I'm trying to make absolutely safe trades<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.466 - 00:00:43.366</b><br>I want trades that I don't even have to think about<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.366 - 00:00:46.166</b><br>I could walk away from the screen it's going to work<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.200 - 00:00:47.733</b><br>it's always going to work<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.733 - 00:00:50.500</b><br>and I want to do it like a professional because<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.333 - 00:00:54.100</b><br>the crypto world that we're in I hate to say this<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.166 - 00:00:56.200</b><br>but it's full of amateurs<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.266 - 00:00:58.166</b><br>it's all amateur traders<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.733 - 00:01:01.900</b><br>it's just beautiful for us<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.900 - 00:01:04.266</b><br>like if you can figure out how to trade properly<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.266 - 00:01:05.933</b><br>like in professional trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.600 - 00:01:07.900</b><br>it's all just free money<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.333 - 00:01:12.400</b><br>in the stock market that I that I often trade in right<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.400 - 00:01:14.266</b><br>the stock market that I daily trade in<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.466 - 00:01:17.866</b><br>those that is full of professionals<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.866 - 00:01:20.900</b><br>you have institutional players and you have banks<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.900 - 00:01:22.300</b><br>and you have market makers<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.300 - 00:01:24.266</b><br>and those guys are trying to trick you<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.266 - 00:01:25.533</b><br>every step of the way<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.000 - 00:01:28.366</b><br>so that's a whole different environment<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.600 - 00:01:31.700</b><br>but in this environment the market is actually trading<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.700 - 00:01:33.333</b><br>the way people are feeling<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.133 - 00:01:36.200</b><br>and that helps a lot that means<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.400 - 00:01:38.333</b><br>news really drops a price hard<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.866 - 00:01:41.533</b><br>and people who believe in the stock<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.533 - 00:01:43.466</b><br>and don't really care about the news really<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.466 - 00:01:44.500</b><br>pick it back up<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.666 - 00:01:47.300</b><br>and so there's all these crazy moves up and down<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.400 - 00:01:51.133</b><br>and all of that is so clearly on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.300 - 00:01:53.166</b><br>that you can get in with<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.366 - 00:01:56.900</b><br>using support or in my case what I call basis<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.966 - 00:01:58.566</b><br>you can get in safely<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.866 - 00:02:00.000</b><br>all over the place<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.600 - 00:02:01.533</b><br>without any worry<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.733 - 00:02:02.300</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.300 - 00:02:02.500</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.500 - 00:02:04.700</b><br>you just have to know how to read the chart properly<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.766 - 00:02:06.500</b><br>but to simplify it all<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.500 - 00:02:09.500</b><br>down support resistance to simplify it to dumb it down<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.066 - 00:02:12.266</b><br>to the most basic thing<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.533 - 00:02:13.933</b><br>this is what you're trying to do<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.200 - 00:02:15.966</b><br>you're trying to answer 1<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.900 - 00:02:20.066</b><br>how many buyers are in the market you're looking at<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.766 - 00:02:24.000</b><br>you're just trying to gauge how many buyers there are<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.533 - 00:02:27.100</b><br>that's it nothing else matters<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.100 - 00:02:28.700</b><br>if you were shorting the market<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.700 - 00:02:29.466</b><br>you'd be trying to<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.466 - 00:02:31.600</b><br>gauge how many sellers there are in the market<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.600 - 00:02:33.000</b><br>because you'd want the market to fall<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.000 - 00:02:35.500</b><br>lower and lower and lower and lower<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.533 - 00:02:38.100</b><br>but in this case we want the market to go up because<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.100 - 00:02:40.600</b><br>we are in a bull market in cryptocurrencies<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.733 - 00:02:40.900</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.900 - 00:02:43.533</b><br>we want the market to go higher and higher and higher<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.733 - 00:02:47.366</b><br>so we want a market or we want a coin in this case<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.600 - 00:02:49.066</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.066 - 00:02:52.200</b><br>everybody's believing in and that have a lot of buyers<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.333 - 00:02:55.700</b><br>so that when the sellers do manage to push it down<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.900 - 00:02:58.400</b><br>you know some bad news comes out or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.500 - 00:03:03.600</b><br>there's so many buyers that just run it right back up<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.933 - 00:03:04.733</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.066 - 00:03:08.500</b><br>we're looking for basis or support<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.166 - 00:03:10.733</b><br>that we can play off of<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.733 - 00:03:11.566</b><br>knowing<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.566 - 00:03:14.666</b><br>that we're completely safe because there's 1,000 guys<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.666 - 00:03:16.766</b><br>behind us looking for a good price<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.000 - 00:03:18.100</b><br>so they're all going to<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.100 - 00:03:20.266</b><br>run this thing up as soon as the panic's over<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.133 - 00:03:21.733</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.733 - 00:03:24.666</b><br>okay so let's take a look at the charts and figure out<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.200 - 00:03:27.600</b><br>whether there's a lot of buyers<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.333 - 00:03:30.966</b><br>so I got myself a candy here<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.066 - 00:03:33.000</b><br>this is a second throw candy Momo<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.400 - 00:03:36.400</b><br>being a wrapper so it's nice and clean<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.366 - 00:03:38.166</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.600 - 00:03:42.166</b><br>I actually is probably gonna harm the video so<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.166 - 00:03:43.866</b><br>you guys won't hear me as clearly<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.933 - 00:03:45.266</b><br>with a candy in my mouth<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.566 - 00:03:46.366</b><br>by the way<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.566 - 00:03:48.733</b><br>okay so here we got<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.100 - 00:03:50.900</b><br>bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.666 - 00:03:52.466</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.600 - 00:03:56.500</b><br>lots of people use moving averages<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.100 - 00:03:59.966</b><br>or trend lines so they'd be looking at this<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.466 - 00:04:02.900</b><br>at this thing and they'd be drawing a trend line<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.166 - 00:04:05.300</b><br>somewhere over here<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.500 - 00:04:08.500</b><br>through all this stuff all the way up to there<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.933 - 00:04:10.200</b><br>and they'd be saying you know if it<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.200 - 00:04:12.100</b><br>breaks this trend line then it's gonna fall<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.566 - 00:04:13.966</b><br>and so you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.100 - 00:04:16.166</b><br>they'd be trying to buy all these little<br></p><p><b>00:04:16.366 - 00:04:17.966</b><br>wherever it comes close to<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.066 - 00:04:19.866</b><br>their moving average or their trend line in<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.300 - 00:04:21.700</b><br>this case it really doesn't come close<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.900 - 00:04:25.100</b><br>hardly at all right here might have been a buying spot<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.666 - 00:04:27.266</b><br>but anyway that's what they use as support<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.266 - 00:04:28.066</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.366 - 00:04:31.066</b><br>they're like this is support this is support support<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.166 - 00:04:32.933</b><br>and then if you were drawing the line the other<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.933 - 00:04:33.500</b><br>direction<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.500 - 00:04:34.300</b><br>whoa<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.066 - 00:04:36.266</b><br>guess I got pressed again<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.700 - 00:04:39.200</b><br>there you go<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.200 - 00:04:40.200</b><br>there's resistance<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.200 - 00:04:42.333</b><br>resistance resistance resistance right<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.900 - 00:04:45.566</b><br>when it finally manages to get past this line<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.500 - 00:04:47.666</b><br>that means it's going higher<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.300 - 00:04:50.200</b><br>and you can trade that way<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.666 - 00:04:51.600</b><br>but it's not easy<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.166 - 00:04:55.266</b><br>okay let's see how can I get rid of everything<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.900 - 00:04:56.700</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.933 - 00:04:58.733</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.800 - 00:05:00.333</b><br>let me just spit out this candy<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.500 - 00:05:01.600</b><br>let's do hard to talk<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.800 - 00:05:02.600</b><br>just a second<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.666 - 00:05:04.300</b><br>okay so I paused the video for a second there<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.300 - 00:05:05.666</b><br>and I got rid of my candy<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.300 - 00:05:08.766</b><br>and let's take a look at support resistance now again<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.766 - 00:05:10.266</b><br>so what normally people do<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.800 - 00:05:13.066</b><br>is let's get a marker up here<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.733 - 00:05:15.666</b><br>yeah blue sounds good<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.666 - 00:05:17.800</b><br>okay so blue will be our resistance<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.800 - 00:05:20.500</b><br>so they would say this is resistance right here<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.500 - 00:05:23.733</b><br>and they would say that this is resistancy<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.733 - 00:05:25.933</b><br>touch once touch twice touch three times<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.933 - 00:05:27.200</b><br>there's some resistance<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.533 - 00:05:29.933</b><br>and over here this looks like resistance<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.000 - 00:05:31.533</b><br>touch touch touch touch<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.533 - 00:05:32.600</b><br>there's resistance<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.800 - 00:05:34.933</b><br>and then for support let's make that yellow<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.933 - 00:05:35.800</b><br>I like yellow<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.600 - 00:05:38.166</b><br>for support they say oh look<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.166 - 00:05:40.133</b><br>look at all this support right here<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.133 - 00:05:41.566</b><br>so support right there<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.933 - 00:05:43.933</b><br>obviously some support down here<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.000 - 00:05:48.000</b><br>you know maybe you'd call this support over here<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.800 - 00:05:50.600</b><br>maybe<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.800 - 00:05:53.200</b><br>one touch 2 touch 3 touch<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.500 - 00:05:56.000</b><br>maybe that support over there maybe<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.866 - 00:05:57.966</b><br>this this over here<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.966 - 00:06:00.200</b><br>could be you see how confusing this is getting<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.700 - 00:06:01.600</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:06:01.966 - 00:06:03.466</b><br>where is support<br></p><p><b>00:06:04.533 - 00:06:05.100</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.100 - 00:06:06.100</b><br>okay this is<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.100 - 00:06:08.600</b><br>obviously this blue line was resistance because<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.700 - 00:06:10.200</b><br>as soon as we cracked that<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.200 - 00:06:12.566</b><br>blue line it seemed like it ran up pretty hard<br></p><p><b>00:06:13.200 -

00:07:29.666</b><br>there's resistance<br></p><p><b>00:07:29.666 - 00:07:30.866</b><br>oh this one doesn't work<br></p><p><b>00:07:31.266 - 00:07:32.866</b><br>was that really resistance<br></p><p><b>00:07:33.300 -

00:07:48.966</b><br>no just a second sorry<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.133 - 00:07:52.666</b><br>so obviously this is support<br></p><p><b>00:07:53.366 - 00:07:54.800</b><br>and when this thing finally<br></p><p><b>00:07:54.800 - 00:07:55.866</b><br>cracked all the way down<br></p><p><b>00:07:55.866 - 00:07:57.933</b><br>it hit this spot and then it bounced up<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.133 - 00:08:00.700</b><br>so obviously that was pretty strong support right<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.100 - 00:08:02.700</b><br>but what about this one<br></p><p><b>00:08:03.466 - 00:08:04.366</b><br>was this support<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.366 - 00:08:04.933</b><br>because look<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.933 - 00:08:07.266</b><br>it seemed like it went through there pretty easy<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.566 - 00:08:09.366</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.900 - 00:08:10.666</b><br>was that support<br></p><p><b>00:08:10.666 - 00:08:13.100</b><br>and then what was this was this support<br></p><p><b>00:08:13.533 - 00:08:15.266</b><br>obviously right here you know<br></p><p><b>00:08:15.600 - 00:08:17.133</b><br>why didn't this hold up<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.133 - 00:08:18.733</b><br>it seemed like it went there through<br></p><p><b>00:08:18.733 - 00:08:20.733</b><br>and then it went through it again pretty easy<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.966 - 00:08:22.933</b><br>and they want to get through it pretty easy<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.733 - 00:08:24.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.333 - 00:08:25.933</b><br>was this ever support<br></p><p><b>00:08:28.266 - 00:08:30.366</b><br>so see it's very confusing<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.600 - 00:08:32.966</b><br>if you start drawing lines all over your chart<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.966 - 00:08:35.933</b><br>and you find places in the past where it seemed like<br></p><p><b>00:08:36.100 - 00:08:37.300</b><br>there was some support<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.533 - 00:08:39.066</b><br>it sometimes works<br></p><p><b>00:08:39.533 - 00:08:42.400</b><br>when you start drawing resistance and<br></p><p><b>00:08:42.466 - 00:08:44.933</b><br>you know it comes up to resistance and<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.933 - 00:08:47.200</b><br>okay I think it's gonna turn and fall from here<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.200 - 00:08:48.200</b><br>I'm gonna short<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.500 - 00:08:50.300</b><br>nope it cracks it and goes up<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.533 - 00:08:52.200</b><br>oh I think it's gonna it's gonna<br></p><p><b>00:08:52.266 - 00:08:54.100</b><br>turn and fall from here and nope<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.100 - 00:08:55.366</b><br>it cracks it and goes up<br></p><p><b>00:08:56.133 - 00:08:56.566</b><br>oh<br></p><p><b>00:08:56.566 - 00:08:58.600</b><br>just seconds all right let me get that out of the way<br></p><p><b>00:08:59.466 - 00:09:00.800</b><br>I don't know how to switch back<br></p><p><b>00:09:02.133 - 00:09:02.900</b><br>okay it<br></p><p><b>00:09:02.900 - 00:09:04.500</b><br>cracks it and it goes down<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.133 - 00:09:07.766</b><br>so like how do you read this stuff and<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.766 - 00:09:10.533</b><br>what's really resistance and what's really support<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.666 - 00:09:12.966</b><br>let me get rid of all these lines<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.200 - 00:09:15.133</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.800 - 00:09:17.666</b><br>what I'm trying to tell you is that<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.966 - 00:09:21.166</b><br>the last support is the one that counts<br></p><p><b>00:09:21.700 - 00:09:24.766</b><br>the very last major support is the one that counts<br></p><p><b>00:09:25.300 - 00:09:27.133</b><br>what you're trying to ask yourself again<br></p><p><b>00:09:27.133 - 00:09:28.366</b><br>let's go back to the question<br></p><p><b>00:09:28.766 - 00:09:30.533</b><br>the question you're trying to answer<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.666 - 00:09:34.133</b><br>is how many buyers are there in this market<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.333 - 00:09:35.566</b><br>and the support<br></p><p><b>00:09:35.800 - 00:09:38.133</b><br>tells you how many buyers there are in the market<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.400 - 00:09:39.733</b><br>so let me demonstrate<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.333 - 00:09:43.500</b><br>so let's zoom in a little bit here right<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.000 - 00:09:45.566</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.566 - 00:09:46.366</b><br>and let's just<br></p><p><b>00:09:46.366 - 00:09:49.133</b><br>let's back up like we've never seen this chart<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.133 - 00:09:50.600</b><br>so let's just go way back here<br></p><p><b>00:09:52.133 - 00:09:54.900</b><br>so here it is a normal grind up<br></p><p><b>00:09:54.966 - 00:09:56.666</b><br>grinding up grinding up grinding up<br></p><p><b>00:09:56.666 - 00:09:57.800</b><br>grinding up grinding up<br></p><p><b>00:09:57.933 - 00:09:58.533</b><br>and then so<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.533 - 00:09:59.500</b><br>I have to move over a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:09:59.500 - 00:10:00.566</b><br>because the camera's in the way<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.766 - 00:10:02.400</b><br>and then you get a drop back<br></p><p><b>00:10:03.366 - 00:10:06.000</b><br>a pretty nice bounce right<br></p><p><b>00:10:06.333 - 00:10:09.266</b><br>so you're starting to think that maybe this is<br></p><p><b>00:10:10.000 - 00:10:12.133</b><br>if I could have a marker<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.533 - 00:10:15.133</b><br>maybe this is looking like support right<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.766 - 00:10:17.533</b><br>and then it keeps on going up<br></p><p><b>00:10:17.533 - 00:10:18.400</b><br>keeps on going up<br></p><p><b>00:10:18.400 - 00:10:19.933</b><br>holy smokes<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.933 - 00:10:23.166</b><br>what a move back down and again<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.100 - 00:10:26.066</b><br>bounce the big bounce<br></p><p><b>00:10:26.166 - 00:10:28.200</b><br>so see if this had come down<br></p><p><b>00:10:28.566 - 00:10:31.100</b><br>and kind of just bounced around little around here<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.600 - 00:10:32.133</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:10:32.133 - 00:10:33.533</b><br>you'd be a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.733 - 00:10:36.200</b><br>iffy about whether this is really going to be supporter<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.200 - 00:10:37.600</b><br>or it's going to continue going down<br></p><p><b>00:10:37.900 - 00:10:42.733</b><br>but this major bounce back up oh sorry I got a texter<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.300 - 00:10:44.200</b><br>okay sorry about that<br></p><p><b>00:10:44.200 - 00:10:48.000</b><br>so this major bounce backup tells you that<br></p><p><b>00:10:49.533 - 00:10:51.133</b><br>there's a lot of buyers in this market<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.366 - 00:10:51.800</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.800 - 00:10:54.666</b><br>obviously in this whole section with all this this<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.900 -

00:13:47.066</b><br>is the support that matters<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.066 - 00:13:48.600</b><br>right now that's what matters<br></p><p><b>00:13:48.600 - 00:13:51.733</b><br>because it bounced from 17 back to 2000<br></p><p><b>00:13:51.966 - 00:13:54.400</b><br>that means the buyers are still there<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.400 - 00:13:56.466</b><br>and they are supporting this price<br></p><p><b>00:13:56.533 - 00:14:00.933</b><br>and they all believe 17 is the bottom if it cracks 17<br></p><p><b>00:14:01.400 - 00:14:03.266</b><br>that's gonna surprise them all<br></p><p><b>00:14:03.333 - 00:14:05.166</b><br>and that's gonna cause people to panic<br></p><p><b>00:14:05.166 - 00:14:06.966</b><br>and that's gonna cause the price to drop<br></p><p><b>00:14:06.966 -

00:15:08.566</b><br>I'd be drawing my base where the heck is my thing<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.300 - 00:15:11.566</b><br>I'd be drawing my base right down here whoo<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.566 - 00:15:13.933</b><br>it was somewhere around 1260 or something<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.800 - 00:15:16.300</b><br>and it's cracked it again<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.566 - 00:15:22.066</b><br>oh my goodness it went all the way down to 1,027 now<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.766 - 00:15:24.533</b><br>can I have a little Raider<br></p><p><b>00:15:25.133 -

00:16:18.666</b><br>she came back down to try to retest the low<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.666 - 00:16:19.600</b><br>but she couldn't<br></p><p><b>00:16:19.866 - 00:16:21.300</b><br>so that makes this<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.266 - 00:16:25.000</b><br>very very clear support right here<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.800 - 00:16:27.366</b><br>this is as clear as day<br></p><p><b>00:16:28.200 - 00:16:30.400</b><br>and then we can continue<br></p><p><b>00:16:30.400 -

00:17:04.300</b><br>when it starts to make higher<br></p><p><b>00:17:04.300 - 00:17:05.800</b><br>highs and it's getting higher<br></p><p><b>00:17:05.900 - 00:17:07.600</b><br>can you call these bases<br></p><p><b>00:17:07.900 -

00:17:19.700</b><br>every single time you go to draw in<br></p><p><b>00:17:19.966 - 00:17:22.400</b><br>your support or your base every single time<br></p><p><b>00:17:22.866 - 00:17:25.400</b><br>are their buyers in the market<br></p><p><b>00:17:25.533 - 00:17:28.366</b><br>does this base signify<br></p><p><b>00:17:28.533 - 00:17:31.566</b><br>there are buyers strong buyers in the market<br></p><p><b>00:17:31.566 - 00:17:34.500</b><br>and you know that wasn't very much of a run up<br></p><p><b>00:17:34.600 - 00:17:39.533</b><br>you know like that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 hours<br></p><p><b>00:17:39.800 - 00:17:41.933</b><br>it didn't move that much it moved from<br></p><p><b>00:17:42.500 - 00:17:44.100</b><br>that still is quite a bit but it moved from<br></p><p><b>00:17:44.100 - 00:17:46.900</b><br>you know a little over 2000 to 22<br></p><p><b>00:17:47.266 - 00:17:48.766</b><br>so it moved 10%<br></p><p><b>00:17:49.266 - 00:17:53.933</b><br>but these other bounces were like from 13 up to 22<br></p><p><b>00:17:54.066 - 00:17:55.800</b><br>so you know that like that's like<br></p><p><b>00:17:56.500 - 00:17:58.600</b><br>that's almost 40%<br></p><p><b>00:17:59.400 - 00:18:01.966</b><br>so move 10 percent that's not that much but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:18:02.100 - 00:18:04.300</b><br>you can call that a base you can play off of that<br></p><p><b>00:18:04.366 - 00:18:05.800</b><br>because it did give you<br></p><p><b>00:18:06.066 - 00:18:07.333</b><br>did at least give you 10 percent<br></p><p><b>00:18:07.333 - 00:18:10.566</b><br>it's just not as strong as those other ones were<br></p><p><b>00:18:12.000 - 00:18:15.400</b><br>so we continue along and of course let's continue up<br></p><p><b>00:18:15.900 - 00:18:17.900</b><br>so let's just let this go up until we<br></p><p><b>00:18:17.900 - 00:18:20.066</b><br>finally see oh that was not too bad<br></p><p><b>00:18:20.066 - 00:18:21.200</b><br>that one's not too bad<br></p><p><b>00:18:21.533 - 00:18:22.933</b><br>you can draw that in if you like<br></p><p><b>00:18:25.000 - 00:18:26.366</b><br>that one's not too bad<br></p><p><b>00:18:27.533 - 00:18:28.566</b><br>let's keep going<br></p><p><b>00:18:28.766 - 00:18:30.166</b><br>see I don't even draw them right<br></p><p><b>00:18:31.366 - 00:18:33.666</b><br>when I'm trading I just look back to the last<br></p><p><b>00:18:33.700 - 00:18:36.133</b><br>one or two bases that are<br></p><p><b>00:18:36.300 - 00:18:38.866</b><br>there in my in my mind after just looking at the chart<br></p><p><b>00:18:38.866 - 00:18:40.866</b><br>oh look how clear that one is<br></p><p><b>00:18:41.133 - 00:18:43.700</b><br>so there you go gets up to 2880<br></p><p><b>00:18:44.066 - 00:18:46.333</b><br>falls all the way back to 2600<br></p><p><b>00:18:46.600 - 00:18:51.700</b><br>2620 something like that so this is a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:18:52.000 - 00:18:53.966</b><br>right there clear as could be<br></p><p><b>00:18:54.133 - 00:18:55.800</b><br>that's what I want to trade off of<br></p><p><b>00:18:56.700 - 00:18:58.800</b><br>and let's keep going<br></p><p><b>00:19:00.100 - 00:19:01.366</b><br>that goes up for a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:19:02.566 - 00:19:05.000</b><br>and oh it comes back to retest it<br></p><p><b>00:19:05.000 - 00:19:07.766</b><br>it cracked it see how it cracked it to 25 20<br></p><p><b>00:19:08.300 - 00:19:10.733</b><br>so this is a very very quick trade<br></p><p><b>00:19:10.733 - 00:19:12.600</b><br>if you're fast enough to catch that<br></p><p><b>00:19:13.066 -

00:19:26.066</b><br>but anyway now your new base is somewhere just under<br></p><p><b>00:19:26.066 - 00:19:28.566</b><br>2550 like this is your new base now<br></p><p><b>00:19:29.133 - 00:19:31.700</b><br>but it did that crack that's very nice<br></p><p><b>00:19:33.333 - 00:19:34.133</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:19:35.166 - 00:19:36.766</b><br>of course it goes all the way back up<br></p><p><b>00:19:36.900 - 00:19:37.600</b><br>so you<br></p><p><b>00:19:37.600 - 00:19:40.066</b><br>if you could have caught that you it would be wonderful<br></p><p><b>00:19:40.066 - 00:19:41.166</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:19:41.800 - 00:19:43.533</b><br>and it's back up<br></p><p><b>00:19:43.533 - 00:19:45.966</b><br>and you know where you can start to draw bases again<br></p><p><b>00:19:45.966 - 00:19:47.766</b><br>like right here you can draw base<br></p><p><b>00:19:48.900 - 00:19:50.733</b><br>right there you can draw a base if you like<br></p><p><b>00:19:51.566 - 00:19:53.466</b><br>and up here see how<br></p><p><b>00:19:53.733 - 00:19:56.166</b><br>see how you got a very small pull back and a<br></p><p><b>00:19:56.166 - 00:19:56.900</b><br>and a push up<br></p><p><b>00:19:56.900 - 00:19:58.066</b><br>it's not strong<br></p><p><b>00:19:58.133 - 00:19:59.766</b><br>you can call it a base<br></p><p><b>00:19:59.766 - 00:20:02.666</b><br>but you know what's your what what is your<br></p><p><b>00:20:04.766 - 00:20:06.066</b><br>what's your profit going to be<br></p><p><b>00:20:06.200 - 00:20:08.800</b><br>like if this cracks this base<br></p><p><b>00:20:08.866 - 00:20:11.500</b><br>you're going to be trying to get in and out on one bar<br></p><p><b>00:20:11.600 - 00:20:13.500</b><br>you know because it's not a major<br></p><p><b>00:20:13.666 - 00:20:15.333</b><br>there's not a major push up<br></p><p><b>00:20:15.500 - 00:20:19.100</b><br>so you know that here at the 2650 range<br></p><p><b>00:20:19.366 - 00:20:20.700</b><br>buyers are thick<br></p><p><b>00:20:20.700 - 00:20:22.466</b><br>everybody wants it at that price<br></p><p><b>00:20:22.733 - 00:20:24.666</b><br>so and you saw them react<br></p><p><b>00:20:24.866 - 00:20:26.600</b><br>they pushed it all up to 28<br></p><p><b>00:20:27.366 - 00:20:28.466</b><br>22 or something<br></p><p><b>00:20:28.600 - 00:20:30.300</b><br>so when they get surprised and it<br></p><p><b>00:20:30.300 - 00:20:32.166</b><br>cracks lower than this price<br></p><p><b>00:20:32.466 - 00:20:33.066</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:20:33.066 - 00:20:34.933</b><br>you're going to get a great panic and you're going to<br></p><p><b>00:20:34.933 - 00:20:36.300</b><br>get a great bounce<br></p><p><b>00:20:36.966 - 00:20:37.800</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:20:37.800 - 00:20:38.666</b><br>let's continue<br></p><p><b>00:20:40.000 - 00:20:40.866</b><br>Dook doo<br></p><p><b>00:20:41.933 - 00:20:44.166</b><br>so this I would call a base that's pretty good<br></p><p><b>00:20:44.166 - 00:20:47.666</b><br>a from 2878 all the way down to 2760<br></p><p><b>00:20:48.000 - 00:20:49.100</b><br>that's not too bad<br></p><p><b>00:20:50.166 - 00:20:52.666</b><br>so you see how as we're going along<br></p><p><b>00:20:52.900 - 00:20:57.100</b><br>we're just allowing the chart to decide what spaces<br></p><p><b>00:20:57.366 - 00:20:58.000</b><br>we're not going<br></p><p><b>00:20:58.000 - 00:21:00.100</b><br>way back in the past and trying to figure it<br></p><p><b>00:21:00.100 - 00:21:00.900</b><br>oh no no<br></p><p><b>00:21:01.300 - 00:21:04.100</b><br>what is current and what is happening right now<br></p><p><b>00:21:04.200 - 00:21:06.066</b><br>where are the buyers willing to step in<br></p><p><b>00:21:06.066 - 00:21:07.400</b><br>and bounce the price<br></p><p><b>00:21:09.133 - 00:21:10.466</b><br>and then we continue<br></p><p><b>00:21:11.466 - 00:21:12.300</b><br>keep so I go up<br></p><p><b>00:21:12.300 - 00:21:13.300</b><br>oh my goodness<br></p><p><b>00:21:13.300 - 00:21:15.366</b><br>okay so we went a little far with that<br></p><p><b>00:21:16.300 - 00:21:18.866</b><br>but and my camera is right in my way<br></p><p><b>00:21:18.866 - 00:21:20.400</b><br>I can't even see what I'm doing<br></p><p><b>00:21:20.866 - 00:21:23.866</b><br>so okay so here was your base<br></p><p><b>00:21:25.266 - 00:21:27.900</b><br>if I could just grab the thing<br></p><p><b>00:21:28.400 - 00:21:30.966</b><br>so here was your base right right there was your base<br></p><p><b>00:21:31.400 - 00:21:34.666</b><br>and it wasn't a very strong base but look at that push<br></p><p><b>00:21:34.933 - 00:21:36.500</b><br>you think you'd be getting killed right<br></p><p><b>00:21:36.500 - 00:21:38.366</b><br>look at this push all the way down to there<br></p><p><b>00:21:38.366 - 00:21:39.733</b><br>let me scroll out a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:21:41.333 - 00:21:44.000</b><br>holy smokes all the way down at 25 20<br></p><p><b>00:21:44.533 - 00:21:46.900</b><br>and so where are you going to buy in this thing<br></p><p><b>00:21:47.000 - 00:21:49.666</b><br>so let's say now let's say you're buying<br></p><p><b>00:21:50.266 - 00:21:53.800</b><br>because that's not a very strong base<br></p><p><b>00:21:53.900 - 00:21:55.766</b><br>you're not going to get in tons<br></p><p><b>00:21:55.766 - 00:21:57.600</b><br>but you might get in right here right<br></p><p><b>00:21:57.600 - 00:22:00.600</b><br>you might say that's kind of a nice drop<br></p><p><b>00:22:00.900 - 00:22:02.733</b><br>and then oh my goodness it keeps going<br></p><p><b>00:22:02.733 - 00:22:04.366</b><br>so you might buy a little bit more there<br></p><p><b>00:22:05.200 - 00:22:07.300</b><br>but as it gets further from you<br></p><p><b>00:22:07.333 - 00:22:09.533</b><br>and this is where you kind of have like<br></p><p><b>00:22:10.566 - 00:22:11.500</b><br>balls of steel<br></p><p><b>00:22:12.000 - 00:22:15.733</b><br>you start to you start to get in a little heavier right<br></p><p><b>00:22:15.733 - 00:22:16.500</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:22:16.500 - 00:22:19.800</b><br>look at the opportunity that now you now you have<br></p><p><b>00:22:20.933 - 00:22:21.766</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:22:22.000 - 00:22:23.200</b><br>let's see what happens<br></p><p><b>00:22:23.933 - 00:22:24.666</b><br>boom<br></p><p><b>00:22:24.666 - 00:22:28.066</b><br>so you get a bounce right back up to your base almost<br></p><p><b>00:22:28.400 - 00:22:29.933</b><br>like just about<br></p><p><b>00:22:29.933 - 00:22:32.133</b><br>like we're talking 20 dollar difference or something<br></p><p><b>00:22:32.600 - 00:22:33.866</b><br>between your base<br></p><p><b>00:22:33.966 - 00:22:35.533</b><br>your base was actually at<br></p><p><b>00:22:36.000 - 00:22:39.800</b><br>2748 and this thing came up to 27 28<br></p><p><b>00:22:40.000 - 00:22:42.166</b><br>so a 20 dollar difference there but<br></p><p><b>00:22:43.566 - 00:22:45.100</b><br>this gets you paid that gets you paid<br></p><p><b>00:22:45.100 - 00:22:47.066</b><br>now do you have time to react to this<br></p><p><b>00:22:47.500 - 00:22:48.566</b><br>you know like look at this<br></p><p><b>00:22:48.566 - 00:22:50.566</b><br>it just went down and went straight back up<br></p><p><b>00:22:50.733 - 00:22:53.366</b><br>do you have time to react well that's one hour<br></p><p><b>00:22:53.733 - 00:22:58.266</b><br>two hours three hours before it got back to<br></p><p><b>00:22:58.666 - 00:23:00.566</b><br>where you would be taking your profits<br></p><p><b>00:23:01.200 - 00:23:02.100</b><br>so that's pretty good<br></p><p><b>00:23:02.100 - 00:23:03.800</b><br>and I wouldn't even take all my profits<br></p><p><b>00:23:03.800 - 00:23:04.700</b><br>to be honest with you<br></p><p><b>00:23:04.700 - 00:23:05.933</b><br>with that much of a drop<br></p><p><b>00:23:06.066 - 00:23:07.266</b><br>I would be thinking<br></p><p><b>00:23:07.566 - 00:23:10.366</b><br>it's probably going to vary its way back up to the top<br></p><p><b>00:23:10.600 - 00:23:11.333</b><br>so I would take<br></p><p><b>00:23:11.333 - 00:23:13.333</b><br>you know three quarters of my profits or<br></p><p><b>00:23:13.333 - 00:23:14.800</b><br>80 percent of my profits<br></p><p><b>00:23:15.533 - 00:23:16.600</b><br>and then I'd be ready for it<br></p><p><b>00:23:16.600 - 00:23:19.333</b><br>if it wants to drop really hard again wonderful<br></p><p><b>00:23:19.466 - 00:23:20.533</b><br>and if it wants to go up<br></p><p><b>00:23:20.533 - 00:23:22.200</b><br>well then I'm going to make a little bit of money<br></p><p><b>00:23:22.400 - 00:23:25.566</b><br>and the percentage that I probably made<br></p><p><b>00:23:25.700 - 00:23:26.800</b><br>probably equals my profit<br></p><p><b>00:23:26.800 - 00:23:28.966</b><br>so I'm probably holding on to something that<br></p><p><b>00:23:29.333 - 00:23:29.966</b><br>doesn't matter<br></p><p><b>00:23:29.966 - 00:23:31.333</b><br>but anyway let's continue<br></p><p><b>00:23:32.700 - 00:23:36.200</b><br>and it cracks that new base so where is our<br></p><p><b>00:23:37.100 - 00:23:38.266</b><br>and we are now<br></p><p><b>00:23:38.266 - 00:23:41.166</b><br>we now got a nice beautiful base right here<br></p><p><b>00:23:41.366 - 00:23:46.300</b><br>it cracks it it goes all the way down so far to 23 20<br></p><p><b>00:23:47.000 - 00:23:48.466</b><br>so where are you gonna buy it<br></p><p><b>00:23:48.466 - 00:23:50.100</b><br>well we can't predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:23:50.100 - 00:23:51.500</b><br>so we might buy it right here<br></p><p><b>00:23:52.100 - 00:23:53.800</b><br>and we might buy it right here<br></p><p><b>00:23:53.800 - 00:23:56.400</b><br>and we might buy it down here if we get really lucky<br></p><p><b>00:23:57.000 - 00:23:59.366</b><br>and let's keep going maybe you'll drop some more<br></p><p><b>00:24:00.933 - 00:24:03.166</b><br>nope it bounces right back to<br></p><p><b>00:24:03.866 - 00:24:07.133</b><br>25 13 so from 22 to<br></p><p><b>00:24:09.766 - 00:24:12.400</b><br>22 80 all the way back to 25 18<br></p><p><b>00:24:14.200 - 00:24:16.800</b><br>okay so now we got a brand new base down there<br></p><p><b>00:24:16.800 - 00:24:17.866</b><br>let's draw that in<br></p><p><b>00:24:19.266 - 00:24:21.866</b><br>so we got a brand new base right here<br></p><p><b>00:24:22.866 - 00:24:23.766</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:24:25.900 - 00:24:27.733</b><br>and let's see if it cracks that<br></p><p><b>00:24:27.766 - 00:24:29.466</b><br>nope it starts to head back up<br></p><p><b>00:24:29.766 - 00:24:31.466</b><br>so we've gotten some profits<br></p><p><b>00:24:31.466 - 00:24:33.133</b><br>and hopefully we've moved that<br></p><p><b>00:24:33.133 - 00:24:35.700</b><br>over into Bitcoin or whatever we decide to do with it<br></p><p><b>00:24:35.966 - 00:24:36.933</b><br>and we're waiting<br></p><p><b>00:24:37.466 - 00:24:41.566</b><br>and now it fell back down but it didn't crack our base<br></p><p><b>00:24:41.566 - 00:24:42.533</b><br>this one doesn't count<br></p><p><b>00:24:42.666 - 00:24:44.966</b><br>right because this is our new base we<br></p><p><b>00:24:45.066 - 00:24:46.333</b><br>got to be patient we got to wait<br></p><p><b>00:24:46.900 - 00:24:48.266</b><br>oh look at that<br></p><p><b>00:24:48.266 - 00:24:50.866</b><br>it cracked it and it got all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:24:51.466 - 00:24:54.500</b><br>20 to 40 I don't know if we would have bought that<br></p><p><b>00:24:54.500 - 00:24:57.100</b><br>I know personally I probably wouldn't have<br></p><p><b>00:24:57.300 - 00:25:00.533</b><br>or I would have gotten very very small right here<br></p><p><b>00:25:01.166 - 00:25:02.700</b><br>really small but<br></p><p><b>00:25:04.266 - 00:25:05.800</b><br>you know it's hard to predict<br></p><p><b>00:25:06.666 - 00:25:07.466</b><br>oh<br></p><p><b>00:25:07.600 - 00:25:12.400</b><br>now 2120 there we go beautiful so<br></p><p><b>00:25:13.300 - 00:25:14.166</b><br>where is my<br></p><p><b>00:25:16.200 - 00:25:19.733</b><br>so 21 20 so finally we got a nice<br></p><p><b>00:25:19.733 - 00:25:20.300</b><br>crack of that<br></p><p><b>00:25:20.300 - 00:25:22.266</b><br>base we might have bought who knows in here<br></p><p><b>00:25:22.566 - 00:25:24.266</b><br>and we got all the way down to 2120<br></p><p><b>00:25:24.266 - 00:25:25.966</b><br>let's see is it gonna go any lower for us<br></p><p><b>00:25:27.266 - 00:25:29.766</b><br>no it bounces all the way back up to our piece<br></p><p><b>00:25:30.533 - 00:25:31.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:25:31.333 - 00:25:35.300</b><br>again within a few seconds you've you're made 200<br></p><p><b>00:25:35.766 - 00:25:39.866</b><br>and then oh a bounce all the way down to is that 1900<br></p><p><b>00:25:40.900 - 00:25:42.133</b><br>holy crap<br></p><p><b>00:25:42.933 - 00:25:45.933</b><br>it's hard to do it I'm gonna split this out so<br></p><p><b>00:25:46.600 -

00:27:01.500</b><br>did some of them buy there<br></p><p><b>00:27:01.500 - 00:27:04.100</b><br>and then and then as it went up sold their position<br></p><p><b>00:27:04.100 - 00:27:05.700</b><br>so now they're not going to be in any pain<br></p><p><b>00:27:05.700 - 00:27:06.966</b><br>when it drops to there<br></p><p><b>00:27:07.266 - 00:27:09.266</b><br>there's all kinds of variables<br></p><p><b>00:27:09.266 - 00:27:12.566</b><br>so what really counts is what's happening right now<br></p><p><b>00:27:12.733 -

00:27:38.733</b><br>the stock will just start<br></p><p><b>00:27:38.800 - 00:27:41.466</b><br>crashing and it doesn't give you any bounces<br></p><p><b>00:27:41.566 - 00:27:44.666</b><br>what it does give you is flags<br></p><p><b>00:27:44.800 -

00:27:59.500</b><br>you expect to see flags on<br></p><p><b>00:27:59.500 - 00:28:02.200</b><br>really bad news or really good news right<br></p><p><b>00:28:02.566 - 00:28:04.400</b><br>but we just don't seem to get them but<br></p><p><b>00:28:04.400 - 00:28:05.666</b><br>here let me just take<br></p><p><b>00:28:05.666 - 00:28:08.966</b><br>two minutes and explain to you how flags work<br></p><p><b>00:28:10.100 - 00:28:10.366</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:28:10.366 - 00:28:11.100</b><br>so I just took a few<br></p><p><b>00:28:11.100 - 00:28:13.466</b><br>seconds and I drew a chart up for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:28:13.800 - 00:28:17.066</b><br>of what would look like in the regular stock market<br></p><p><b>00:28:17.200 - 00:28:19.666</b><br>and so again if we were to be drawing<br></p><p><b>00:28:20.100 - 00:28:23.133</b><br>bases and resistance and whatnot we'd probably say<br></p><p><b>00:28:23.266 - 00:28:25.566</b><br>this is a base and this is a base and there you go<br></p><p><b>00:28:25.566 - 00:28:27.933</b><br>right and over here you have<br></p><p><b>00:28:28.366 - 00:28:32.966</b><br>some resistance which became support or a base<br></p><p><b>00:28:33.200 - 00:28:35.100</b><br>so there's you know there's some support<br></p><p><b>00:28:35.100 - 00:28:35.766</b><br>there's some support<br></p><p><b>00:28:35.766 - 00:28:37.533</b><br>and then over here this resistance<br></p><p><b>00:28:37.800 - 00:28:38.800</b><br>became support<br></p><p><b>00:28:39.200 - 00:28:41.333</b><br>and so on so forth but then you get to here<br></p><p><b>00:28:42.066 - 00:28:45.200</b><br>up here and or even here<br></p><p><b>00:28:46.400 - 00:28:48.966</b><br>you start to see this kind of stuff happening<br></p><p><b>00:28:49.600 - 00:28:51.500</b><br>and you see this happening<br></p><p><b>00:28:51.866 - 00:28:53.166</b><br>and it's like wait a second<br></p><p><b>00:28:53.733 - 00:28:55.966</b><br>usually what happens is<br></p><p><b>00:28:57.000 - 00:28:59.600</b><br>you get to a point where the market doesn't seem<br></p><p><b>00:28:59.600 - 00:29:01.333</b><br>like where the sellers kind of take over<br></p><p><b>00:29:01.500 - 00:29:04.366</b><br>and it pushes it back and you retest support<br></p><p><b>00:29:04.666 - 00:29:06.000</b><br>and then it goes up right<br></p><p><b>00:29:06.000 - 00:29:08.500</b><br>and you retest that support and then it goes up<br></p><p><b>00:29:08.866 - 00:29:09.533</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:29:09.533 - 00:29:15.133</b><br>over here imagine all the guys all the professionals<br></p><p><b>00:29:15.366 - 00:29:17.333</b><br>all those well not necessarily professionals<br></p><p><b>00:29:17.333 - 00:29:17.766</b><br>but all those<br></p><p><b>00:29:17.766 - 00:29:20.933</b><br>traders that are trying to short the market right here<br></p><p><b>00:29:21.266 - 00:29:22.333</b><br>they're used to this right<br></p><p><b>00:29:22.333 - 00:29:22.700</b><br>as soon<br></p><p><b>00:29:22.700 - 00:29:24.900</b><br>as the market doesn't seem to want to go any higher<br></p><p><b>00:29:25.100 - 00:29:26.600</b><br>they expect it to turn over<br></p><p><b>00:29:26.700 - 00:29:29.533</b><br>and to give them at least this profit over here<br></p><p><b>00:29:29.866 - 00:29:31.733</b><br>but instead what happens is<br></p><p><b>00:29:31.900 - 00:29:34.266</b><br>it starts consolidating sideways<br></p><p><b>00:29:34.366 - 00:29:36.933</b><br>thinner and thinner and thinner and then takes off<br></p><p><b>00:29:37.166 - 00:29:38.666</b><br>and all these guys<br></p><p><b>00:29:38.666 - 00:29:42.100</b><br>that shorted right here are now forced to squeeze<br></p><p><b>00:29:42.200 - 00:29:45.700</b><br>and buy the stock at a higher price and lose money<br></p><p><b>00:29:45.933 - 00:29:46.733</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:29:47.400 - 00:29:50.000</b><br>there was no push there was no pull back<br></p><p><b>00:29:50.000 - 00:29:51.266</b><br>there was no push so<br></p><p><b>00:29:54.533 - 00:29:55.700</b><br>that's what happens<br></p><p><b>00:29:55.800 - 00:29:57.366</b><br>these flagging patterns happen<br></p><p><b>00:29:57.600 - 00:29:59.300</b><br>but what I'm going to show you is the<br></p><p><b>00:29:59.300 - 00:30:00.400</b><br>trade that I got into yesterday<br></p><p><b>00:30:00.400 - 00:30:02.966</b><br>which was just like a penny stock trade<br></p><p><b>00:30:03.400 - 00:30:05.466</b><br>where the worst news came out<br></p><p><b>00:30:05.466 -

00:30:38.700</b><br>look at the bounce you got off of it there<br></p><p><b>00:30:38.866 - 00:30:41.566</b><br>that says we've got support right here<br></p><p><b>00:30:42.100 - 00:30:46.333</b><br>so then all of a sudden look at that crash<br></p><p><b>00:30:46.900 -

00:32:10.966</b><br>tried to figure out what's making this thing drop<br></p><p><b>00:32:10.966 - 00:32:12.100</b><br>I bought right here<br></p><p><b>00:32:12.600 - 00:32:15.066</b><br>expecting it to go right back up to my base<br></p><p><b>00:32:15.466 - 00:32:17.200</b><br>and then oh my goodness it went further<br></p><p><b>00:32:17.200 - 00:32:18.166</b><br>I bought right there<br></p><p><b>00:32:18.466 - 00:32:20.500</b><br>and it went further I bought right there<br></p><p><b>00:32:21.133 - 00:32:24.000</b><br>and then I figured I found out what it was<br></p><p><b>00:32:24.000 - 00:32:25.733</b><br>you know the delisting thing that's terrible<br></p><p><b>00:32:25.866 - 00:32:28.900</b><br>so I'm no longer expecting it to go to my base because<br></p><p><b>00:32:29.166 - 00:32:31.300</b><br>that news trumps all things<br></p><p><b>00:32:31.300 - 00:32:33.766</b><br>I mean that it's not gonna exist soon<br></p><p><b>00:32:33.766 - 00:32:36.500</b><br>well it'll still exist stealth coin or whatever it is<br></p><p><b>00:32:37.333 - 00:32:39.600</b><br>you know will exist out there but nobody's trading it<br></p><p><b>00:32:39.600 - 00:32:40.400</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:32:41.166 - 00:32:43.200</b><br>I got to get out of this thing so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:32:43.300 - 00:32:44.666</b><br>so I bought there I bought there<br></p><p><b>00:32:44.666 - 00:32:47.300</b><br>I bought there and you can see that I sold right there<br></p><p><b>00:32:47.533 - 00:32:51.000</b><br>and what are those percentages I bought at 28 90<br></p><p><b>00:32:51.300 - 00:32:52.933</b><br>I bought at 2600<br></p><p><b>00:32:53.400 - 00:32:55.800</b><br>I bought at 21<br></p><p><b>00:32:56.966 - 00:32:58.866</b><br>I sold all of it at<br></p><p><b>00:32:58.900 - 00:33:00.533</b><br></p><p><b>00:33:01.200 - 00:33:05.300</b><br>31 so I think 21 to 31 that's 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:33:05.800 - 00:33:07.266</b><br>on just that one<br></p><p><b>00:33:07.533 - 00:33:08.900</b><br>on that on that one buy<br></p><p><b>00:33:08.900 - 00:33:11.300</b><br>and then I don't know what it was on this one the 20<br></p><p><b>00:33:11.666 - 00:33:14.566</b><br>20 percent or whatever 10% but<br></p><p><b>00:33:15.366 - 00:33:16.800</b><br>big percentages<br></p><p><b>00:33:16.933 - 00:33:19.566</b><br>so I was ready for this drop but this time<br></p><p><b>00:33:19.566 - 00:33:22.566</b><br>okay so here's our new base where's our little thing<br></p><p><b>00:33:23.066 - 00:33:24.600</b><br>so here's our new base right<br></p><p><b>00:33:25.466 - 00:33:27.766</b><br>and this time I didn't even let it pass the base<br></p><p><b>00:33:27.766 - 00:33:28.700</b><br>I got a<br></p><p><b>00:33:29.366 - 00:33:30.100</b><br>little bit a little<br></p><p><b>00:33:30.100 - 00:33:30.800</b><br>nibble right here<br></p><p><b>00:33:30.800 - 00:33:32.266</b><br>in case we get a little bit of a balance<br></p><p><b>00:33:32.266 - 00:33:35.133</b><br>because I knew everybody's got nervous hands on this<br></p><p><b>00:33:35.566 - 00:33:39.066</b><br>and then I got boom I got 15's<br></p><p><b>00:33:39.366 - 00:33:45.366</b><br>and I got 12s and I've got tens 10 5<br></p><p><b>00:33:46.000 - 00:33:48.700</b><br>wow you know and then and then<br></p><p><b>00:33:49.166 - 00:33:52.100</b><br>at this 10 5 I bought lots right<br></p><p><b>00:33:52.166 - 00:33:54.566</b><br>so over here I just nibbled over here<br></p><p><b>00:33:54.566 - 00:33:56.366</b><br>I got you know a nice position<br></p><p><b>00:33:56.566 - 00:33:58.766</b><br>over here I got a much nicer position over here<br></p><p><b>00:33:58.766 - 00:33:59.933</b><br>I really got in<br></p><p><b>00:34:00.333 - 00:34:02.133</b><br>so that's the way I'm<br></p><p><b>00:34:02.300 - 00:34:04.700</b><br>because because I have the experience<br></p><p><b>00:34:05.533 - 00:34:07.000</b><br>I know how these things play out<br></p><p><b>00:34:07.000 - 00:34:10.000</b><br>even though the news is the worst news you could get<br></p><p><b>00:34:10.500 - 00:34:12.200</b><br>because it's the crypto market<br></p><p><b>00:34:12.600 - 00:34:14.300</b><br>it still works out<br></p><p><b>00:34:14.700 - 00:34:17.300</b><br>these are safe trades so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:34:18.500 - 00:34:19.566</b><br>so yeah blah blah blah<br></p><p><b>00:34:19.566 - 00:34:22.800</b><br>so here I am buying at 10 and I sold at<br></p><p><b>00:34:24.466 - 00:34:29.300</b><br>1950 191950 and then I sold the rest<br></p><p><b>00:34:29.300 - 00:34:31.700</b><br>I waited to see if it would give me a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:34:31.800 - 00:34:33.700</b><br>but it didn't want to it pulled back<br></p><p><b>00:34:33.866 - 00:34:35.766</b><br>and then as soon as it gave me just a touch more<br></p><p><b>00:34:35.766 - 00:34:36.800</b><br>just over the 20<br></p><p><b>00:34:36.966 - 00:34:38.100</b><br>I sold the rest out<br></p><p><b>00:34:38.733 - 00:34:42.600</b><br>so just a beautiful trade on something that<br></p><p><b>00:34:44.600 - 00:34:45.666</b><br>take those off<br></p><p><b>00:34:46.166 - 00:34:47.400</b><br>take my history off<br></p><p><b>00:34:47.700 - 00:34:50.333</b><br>on something that you be like holy smokes<br></p><p><b>00:34:50.333 - 00:34:52.166</b><br>you can only lose money on this<br></p><p><b>00:34:52.800 - 00:34:54.800</b><br>but not if you understand how to trade<br></p><p><b>00:34:54.900 - 00:34:57.666</b><br>not if you can draw your basis properly<br></p><p><b>00:34:58.133 - 00:35:00.966</b><br>and you don't have to be scared<br></p><p><b>00:35:01.133 - 00:35:02.500</b><br>okay I didn't put<br></p><p><b>00:35:02.500 - 00:35:05.166</b><br>thousands and thousands of dollars into this<br></p><p><b>00:35:05.500 -

00:35:31.966</b><br>all of this other volume sorry let's go to a one hour<br></p><p><b>00:35:34.866 - 00:35:37.366</b><br>let me refresh this page maybe<br></p><p><b>00:35:39.066 - 00:35:40.900</b><br>here let me pause the video until it comes back<br></p><p><b>00:35:41.933 - 00:35:45.766</b><br>okay so I got it to refresh so all of this happened<br></p><p><b>00:35:45.766 - 00:35:46.300</b><br>all of this<br></p><p><b>00:35:46.300 - 00:35:48.533</b><br>volume right here where it ran all the way up to there<br></p><p><b>00:35:48.533 - 00:35:50.366</b><br>and I backed down and up and down and up<br></p><p><b>00:35:50.366 - 00:35:52.666</b><br>and now all that's people believing in this thing<br></p><p><b>00:35:53.066 - 00:35:55.333</b><br>in this coin so this was just<br></p><p><b>00:35:55.466 - 00:35:58.533</b><br>this is only just a shock of that they're losing<br></p><p><b>00:35:58.566 - 00:35:59.766</b><br>their listing on<br></p><p><b>00:36:00.000 - 00:36:02.200</b><br>Bittrax that doesn't mean that the coins over<br></p><p><b>00:36:02.366 -

00:36:15.166</b><br>probably buy this thing back up to<br></p><p><b>00:36:15.166 - 00:36:17.600</b><br>35 or something before the whole thing closes<br></p><p><b>00:36:17.666 - 00:36:18.800</b><br>they're getting rid of it<br></p><p><b>00:36:18.800 -

00:36:26.566</b><br>finish it but anyway okay so<br></p><p><b>00:36:27.200 - 00:36:28.166</b><br>let's end here<br></p><p><b>00:36:28.600 - 00:36:30.733</b><br>I hope that this enlightens you a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:36:30.733 - 00:36:32.200</b><br>about support resistance<br></p><p><b>00:36:32.400 - 00:36:35.366</b><br>the main things in this video that<br></p><p><b>00:36:35.366 - 00:36:37.066</b><br>let me rehilight them for you<br></p><p><b>00:36:37.866 - 00:36:39.800</b><br>so the most important thing<br></p><p><b>00:36:40.600 - 00:36:42.966</b><br>is the question you're trying to get<br></p><p><b>00:36:43.000 - 00:36:44.666</b><br>you're trying to answer the question<br></p><p><b>00:36:45.066 - 00:36:47.366</b><br>are there a lot of buyers in this market<br></p><p><b>00:36:47.500 - 00:36:49.200</b><br>and how do you answer that question<br></p><p><b>00:36:49.733 - 00:36:51.666</b><br>by when you when you<br></p><p><b>00:36:51.700 - 00:36:52.766</b><br>plug in a base<br></p><p><b>00:36:52.766 - 00:36:55.500</b><br>you get a nice big bounce off of that base<br></p><p><b>00:36:55.533 - 00:36:56.466</b><br>if you get a nice<br></p><p><b>00:36:56.466 -

00:37:04.966</b><br>then you know there's buyers in the market<br></p><p><b>00:37:05.166 - 00:37:07.600</b><br>now in the stock market if it fell<br></p><p><b>00:37:07.900 - 00:37:09.666</b><br>and you get a flag<br></p><p><b>00:37:09.666 -

00:37:15.500</b><br>that means there are so many sellers in the market<br></p><p><b>00:37:15.500 - 00:37:17.766</b><br>that the buyers couldn't even bounce it<br></p><p><b>00:37:17.766 - 00:37:20.100</b><br>like they are supposed to back to your base<br></p><p><b>00:37:20.666 - 00:37:21.466</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:37:21.966 - 00:37:23.000</b><br>that would be terrible<br></p><p><b>00:37:23.133 - 00:37:25.266</b><br>in our market that just doesn't happen<br></p><p><b>00:37:25.400 - 00:37:26.266</b><br>you know maybe<br></p><p><b>00:37:26.266 - 00:37:28.800</b><br>you could almost say this is a flag here but<br></p><p><b>00:37:29.200 - 00:37:31.766</b><br>that almost never well especially in Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:37:32.266 - 00:37:34.533</b><br>or Ethereum or most of the coins<br></p><p><b>00:37:34.666 - 00:37:36.733</b><br>you won't see flags because<br></p><p><b>00:37:37.366 - 00:37:39.466</b><br>there's nobody manipulating the prices that way<br></p><p><b>00:37:39.466 -

00:37:51.066</b><br>is you're asking that<br></p><p><b>00:37:51.066 - 00:37:52.400</b><br>question and you're trying to get the answer<br></p><p><b>00:37:52.400 - 00:37:53.800</b><br>is there are a lot of buyers in the market<br></p><p><b>00:37:53.800 - 00:37:55.666</b><br>and the second thing that<br></p><p><b>00:37:55.766 - 00:37:57.466</b><br>I'm going to highlight about this video<br></p><p><b>00:37:57.900 - 00:38:00.400</b><br>is keep your bases current<br></p><p><b>00:38:00.933 -

00:38:33.666</b><br>there'll be a huge surprise<br></p><p><b>00:38:33.900 - 00:38:35.300</b><br>everybody will panic<br></p><p><b>00:38:35.333 - 00:38:36.733</b><br>the price will drop<br></p><p><b>00:38:36.733 -

00:38:46.566</b><br>now I know that<br></p><p><b>00:38:47.600 - 00:38:48.166</b><br>the way I<br></p><p><b>00:38:48.166 - 00:38:50.266</b><br>look at support and resistance is not the same<br></p><p><b>00:38:50.266 - 00:38:51.066</b><br>as everybody else<br></p><p><b>00:38:51.066 - 00:38:53.266</b><br>and I know there will be a lot of people who have<br></p><p><b>00:38:53.466 - 00:38:55.866</b><br>questions and comments on this video<br></p><p><b>00:38:56.066 - 00:38:58.200</b><br>saying they see things a different way<br></p><p><b>00:38:58.200 - 00:38:59.566</b><br>and what about all the missed<br></p><p><b>00:38:59.566 - 00:39:01.700</b><br>opportunities when there was just a little bit of this<br></p><p><b>00:39:01.700 - 00:39:02.300</b><br>and there'll be<br></p><p><b>00:39:02.300 - 00:39:03.800</b><br>all kinds of questions<br></p><p><b>00:39:04.266 - 00:39:06.866</b><br>you know please rewatch this video again<br></p><p><b>00:39:07.666 - 00:39:11.066</b><br>or maybe all even just respond to a rewatch this video<br></p><p><b>00:39:11.066 - 00:39:12.800</b><br>on some of your questions if<br></p><p><b>00:39:12.933 - 00:39:14.333</b><br>they were covered in this video<br></p><p><b>00:39:14.800 - 00:39:16.900</b><br>but understand this is the way I see it<br></p><p><b>00:39:17.400 - 00:39:18.733</b><br>this is how I trade<br></p><p><b>00:39:18.933 - 00:39:21.933</b><br>and I've been doing it for over 10 years you know like<br></p><p><b>00:39:22.100 - 00:39:23.400</b><br>I'm a long term<br></p><p><b>00:39:23.400 - 00:39:26.266</b><br>trader and I trade in a much more harsh environment<br></p><p><b>00:39:26.266 - 00:39:27.566</b><br>on the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:39:27.900 - 00:39:31.466</b><br>so I'm really used to the tricks and<br></p><p><b>00:39:31.900 - 00:39:35.333</b><br>and so on on the crypto world which we're in<br></p><p><b>00:39:35.600 - 00:39:37.766</b><br>it's so easy like really<br></p><p><b>00:39:37.866 - 00:39:41.000</b><br>it's it's very very very simple<br></p><p><b>00:39:41.133 - 00:39:44.466</b><br>to draw your bases find the surprises<br></p><p><b>00:39:44.600 - 00:39:48.000</b><br>and then make my capitalize on those surprises<br></p><p><b>00:39:48.000 - 00:39:50.800</b><br>and then what I have always told you on all the other<br></p><p><b>00:39:51.000 - 00:39:53.000</b><br>videos I'm going to end the video now but<br></p><p><b>00:39:53.500 - 00:39:55.300</b><br>what I always do what I do<br></p><p><b>00:39:56.100 - 00:39:59.300</b><br>is I use my profits from the coin that I'm trading<br></p><p><b>00:39:59.666 - 00:40:02.766</b><br>to keep a little bit of the coin and to store it away<br></p><p><b>00:40:02.766 - 00:40:03.566</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:40:03.766 - 00:40:05.600</b><br>be in the coin for the future<br></p><p><b>00:40:06.266 - 00:40:09.600</b><br>and so that's combining trading and investing together<br></p><p><b>00:40:09.800 - 00:40:11.066</b><br>but it makes it so you can<br></p><p><b>00:40:11.066 - 00:40:12.700</b><br>sleep at night because you never have any<br></p><p><b>00:40:12.700 - 00:40:13.566</b><br>skin in the game<br></p><p><b>00:40:13.733 - 00:40:17.533</b><br>and if the coin decides to take off like recently<br></p><p><b>00:40:18.266 - 00:40:19.300</b><br>my goodness<br></p><p><b>00:40:20.000 - 00:40:21.733</b><br>this pay coin that I was in<br></p><p><b>00:40:22.866 - 00:40:24.766</b><br>who just took off big time<br></p><p><b>00:40:24.766 - 00:40:26.366</b><br>and I was buying it down here<br></p><p><b>00:40:26.600 - 00:40:27.533</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:40:28.300 - 00:40:30.166</b><br>EOS the other day well<br></p><p><b>00:40:31.133 - 00:40:34.100</b><br>today too but EOS like<br></p><p><b>00:40:34.100 - 00:40:37.200</b><br>you know I was buying over here and selling over there<br></p><p><b>00:40:37.200 - 00:40:39.133</b><br>and selling a little bit over here and then<br></p><p><b>00:40:39.200 - 00:40:41.600</b><br>you know I didn't keep any but boy did it ever go up<br></p><p><b>00:40:42.100 - 00:40:42.333</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:40:42.333 - 00:40:43.200</b><br>anyway that's a wrap<br></p><p><b>00:40:43.200 - 00:40:45.200</b><br>I have to stop here wrap 40 minutes<br></p><p><b>00:40:45.200 - 00:40:47.066</b><br>so I didn't mean for the video this long<br></p><p><b>00:40:47.066 - 00:40:48.466</b><br>but I knew when I was starting the video<br></p><p><b>00:40:48.466 - 00:40:50.566</b><br>that when we get into technical analysis<br></p><p><b>00:40:50.800 - 00:40:52.133</b><br>I mean that just takes time<br></p><p><b>00:40:52.133 - 00:40:53.800</b><br>so I hope that you guys were<br></p><p><b>00:40:53.800 - 00:40:55.400</b><br>able to handle 40 minute video<br></p><p><b>00:40:55.700 - 00:40:58.166</b><br>and I hope that it really explained<br></p><p><b>00:40:58.366 - 00:40:59.766</b><br>you know support and resistance for you<br></p><p><b>00:40:59.766 - 00:41:00.800</b><br>and how I look at it<br></p><p><b>00:41:00.866 - 00:41:02.566</b><br>and I like to think that<br></p><p><b>00:41:02.566 - 00:41:04.400</b><br>I look at it like a professional does<br></p><p><b>00:41:04.800 - 00:41:06.166</b><br>and that's why all my trades work<br></p></body></html>
