00:00:46.866</b><br>that I can't share what I've Learned with you<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.600 - 00:00:48.300</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.300 - 00:00:50.800</b><br>I listed a bunch of questions on<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.100 - 00:00:51.333</b><br>the<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.333 - 00:00:53.666</b><br>blog post that's going to be connected to this video<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.133 - 00:00:55.800</b><br>and I'm going to go through them with you<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.800 - 00:00:57.366</b><br>and let's talk about them<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.533 - 00:00:59.400</b><br>let me answer those questions for you<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.866 - 00:01:02.600</b><br>and just kind of simplify the market so that you can<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.600 - 00:01:03.400</b><br>understand<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.166 - 00:01:04.800</b><br>something that<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.800 - 00:01:07.700</b><br>supposed to be really complicated can be very simple<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.466 - 00:01:09.966</b><br>so the first question is<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.200 - 00:01:12.600</b><br>what is the stock market so what is the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.600 - 00:01:13.533</b><br>it's an option<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.533 - 00:01:14.100</b><br>basically<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.100 - 00:01:15.500</b><br>that's what stock market<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.266 - 00:01:17.566</b><br>is it's an online option<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.566 - 00:01:19.600</b><br>it used to not be an online option<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.766 - 00:01:20.600</b><br>it used to have to call you<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.600 - 00:01:21.800</b><br>broker and then the broker would<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.800 - 00:01:23.466</b><br>call somebody on the trading floor<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.466 - 00:01:24.400</b><br>and they would actually<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.400 - 00:01:27.066</b><br>trade little tickets amongst each other<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.733 - 00:01:29.400</b><br>but now it's an option and<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.533 - 00:01:32.400</b><br>it's a lot bigger than just stocks you know now<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.400 - 00:01:32.700</b><br>we have<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.700 - 00:01:35.066</b><br>cryptocurrencies and we have regular currencies we have<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.066 - 00:01:36.166</b><br>commodities and we have<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.166 - 00:01:38.200</b><br>options and we have all kinds of things<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.466 - 00:01:43.133</b><br>but basically it's trading one thing with somebody else<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.133 - 00:01:46.500</b><br>and agreeing on a price between the two of you<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.800 - 00:01:49.066</b><br>so that's what an auction is<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.066 - 00:01:52.066</b><br>if you go on eBay and you want to buy a soccer ball<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.900 - 00:01:55.966</b><br>then you might bid 10 dollars since somebody else bids<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.966 - 00:01:57.900</b><br>11 dollars and another person builds<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.900 - 00:01:59.733</b><br>1150 and so on and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.933 - 00:02:03.366</b><br>until finally the seller says or the time elapses on<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.366 - 00:02:03.700</b><br>eBay<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.700 - 00:02:05.766</b><br>but the seller agrees with the price and says okay<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.766 - 00:02:07.166</b><br>I'll take 1150<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.500 - 00:02:08.300</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.300 - 00:02:08.866</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.866 - 00:02:10.266</b><br>they they make that trade<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.300 - 00:02:12.266</b><br>well in this case with<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.700 - 00:02:13.933</b><br>with the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.500 - 00:02:16.200</b><br>you're saying I'm willing to pay<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.400 - 00:02:19.366</b><br>400 dollars for apple stock and<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.666 - 00:02:20.166</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.166 - 00:02:22.400</b><br>there might be a whole bunch of sellers above you<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.566 - 00:02:25.266</b><br>that are willing to take 410 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.266 - 00:02:28.466</b><br>but you're willing to bid 400 dollars and<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.600 - 00:02:31.866</b><br>somebody else comes in and says oh I'll bid 411<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.866 - 00:02:34.166</b><br>dollars and then this guy this seller over here<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.266 - 00:02:38.600</b><br>says okay I'll give it away for 411 and a price<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.666 - 00:02:41.000</b><br>is agreed upon and then that's a transaction<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.800 - 00:02:44.000</b><br>so that's all it is it's just an option<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.100 - 00:02:46.000</b><br>No. 2<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.800 - 00:02:48.166</b><br>who are the players<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.366 - 00:02:51.766</b><br>so there's retail investors and that's me<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.800 - 00:02:52.733</b><br>and that's you<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.733 - 00:02:55.766</b><br>and then there's bigger guys there's<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.766 - 00:02:58.900</b><br>different companies and whatnot there's market makers<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.966 - 00:03:01.366</b><br>and a market maker has to follow rules<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.133 - 00:03:03.166</b><br>I don't want to go too<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.166 - 00:03:04.133</b><br>elaborate on all this<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.133 - 00:03:05.300</b><br>because it's going to make this video<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.300 - 00:03:06.366</b><br>super super long<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.500 - 00:03:07.566</b><br>but anyway the market<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.700 - 00:03:10.766</b><br>maker has to have a buy and a sell on the market<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.966 - 00:03:13.133</b><br>in order to stay a market maker<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.400 - 00:03:17.600</b><br>and so these guys have lots of money and<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.133 - 00:03:19.266</b><br>they make a market<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.266 - 00:03:20.700</b><br>because they are always willing to buy it<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.700 - 00:03:21.366</b><br>at some price<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.366 - 00:03:23.133</b><br>and they are always willing to sell it at some price<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.133 - 00:03:24.400</b><br>and they have to list both of those<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.400 - 00:03:25.400</b><br>things on the market<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.566 - 00:03:28.333</b><br>and that allows for something like right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.333 - 00:03:29.500</b><br>see the market right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.666 - 00:03:32.300</b><br>that allows for you to have a whole bunch of sellers<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.300 - 00:03:34.133</b><br>and a whole bunch of buyers<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.933 - 00:03:36.066</b><br>even if<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.533 - 00:03:37.900</b><br>they're not just<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.000 - 00:03:39.133</b><br>common people<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.133 - 00:03:39.966</b><br>you know like like<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.966 - 00:03:41.333</b><br>let's say you come to the market right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.333 - 00:03:42.400</b><br>and you want to buy something<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.666 - 00:03:43.466</b><br>well you're gonna<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.500 - 00:03:45.400</b><br>you're gonna jump on the bid here or you're gonna<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.400 - 00:03:47.666</b><br>buy the ask so either you're gonna<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.700 - 00:03:50.933</b><br>pay what these guys are willing to sell it to you for<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.166 - 00:03:52.666</b><br>or you're gonna offer<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.700 - 00:03:56.100</b><br>you know a lower price and hope that you get filled<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.400 - 00:03:59.333</b><br>but you're only doing one thing<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.466 - 00:04:01.900</b><br>you're just coming in and you're either buying it<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.133 - 00:04:04.400</b><br>or later on you might be selling it<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.533 - 00:04:06.100</b><br>but you're not buying and selling<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.100 - 00:04:08.733</b><br>because you don't own any to sell so<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.333 - 00:04:11.500</b><br>but a market maker keeps an inventory<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.566 - 00:04:15.333</b><br>and so he sits with some stuff to sell and he also<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.533 - 00:04:17.966</b><br>has some money sitting there wanting to buy<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.133 - 00:04:19.333</b><br>so he's making a market<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.333 - 00:04:22.066</b><br>it's a good name for a market maker<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.933 - 00:04:24.900</b><br>okay so the third question is<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.166 - 00:04:26.533</b><br>is there a holy grail system<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.066 - 00:04:28.500</b><br>is there some magical system<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.500 - 00:04:30.533</b><br>where you can just sit back and make a ton of money<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.966 - 00:04:32.766</b><br>new<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.566 - 00:04:34.133</b><br>no<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.133 - 00:04:35.866</b><br>no there's not if there was<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.400 - 00:04:37.800</b><br>some magical system<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.300 - 00:04:40.700</b><br>you know everybody be rich<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.866 - 00:04:43.200</b><br>people just want to be able to buy something and<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.333 - 00:04:44.800</b><br>come back in a day or two<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.866 - 00:04:47.133</b><br>and it's worth so much more money and<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.133 - 00:04:48.500</b><br>never have to think about<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.700 - 00:04:50.333</b><br>you know stopping themselves out<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.333 - 00:04:53.533</b><br>or getting out of a bad situation or taking a loss or<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.533 - 00:04:54.500</b><br>anything like that<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.166 - 00:04:58.300</b><br>you know they want some indicator<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.700 - 00:05:02.666</b><br>that will say by now and sell now and so forth and<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.200 - 00:05:04.500</b><br>yeah that doesn't exist<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.900 - 00:05:09.600</b><br>what it really comes down to is probabilities<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.900 - 00:05:10.700</b><br>you have to<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.900 - 00:05:11.700</b><br>understand<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.700 - 00:05:14.133</b><br>probabilities and that's why I talk a lot in my<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.333 - 00:05:18.100</b><br>videos about percentages to think in percentages<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.100 - 00:05:20.166</b><br>well you also got to think in probabilities<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.300 - 00:05:24.600</b><br>percentages is how much can I earn on this trade like<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.300 - 00:05:27.800</b><br>am I buying this thing for 10 and selling it for 13<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.333 - 00:05:29.866</b><br>so I'm making 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.100 - 00:05:31.366</b><br>that's percentages<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.466 - 00:05:32.700</b><br>probabilities<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.733 - 00:05:36.333</b><br>is if I look at the chart and I read the story<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.200 - 00:05:41.133</b><br>how many times does this trade that I'm about to take<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.566 - 00:05:43.400</b><br>if I see<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.466 - 00:05:45.133</b><br>other identical trades in the past<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.133 - 00:05:46.933</b><br>how many times has this worked<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.000 - 00:05:48.133</b><br>and if it's worked<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.466 - 00:05:51.800</b><br>4 five six seven times wow<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.000 - 00:05:55.300</b><br>so now I've got a 70 percent chance<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.566 - 00:05:57.966</b><br>that this trade is going to be a winner if it's work<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.100 -

00:09:45.166</b><br>that doesn't bounce<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.166 - 00:09:48.266</b><br>because there's nothing of value left to the shares<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.266 - 00:09:50.266</b><br>and I had no way of knowing that<br></p><p><b>00:09:50.333 -

00:10:02.300</b><br>there was no news anywhere<br></p><p><b>00:10:02.333 - 00:10:03.133</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:10:03.366 - 00:10:05.933</b><br>you know when that happens and I and I have a right day<br></p><p><b>00:10:06.066 - 00:10:08.066</b><br>I'm like thinking to myself well<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.866 - 00:10:11.133</b><br>you know it's rough it sucks but<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.066 - 00:10:13.166</b><br>I didn't do anything wrong<br></p><p><b>00:10:13.166 -

00:12:26.966</b><br>is<br></p><p><b>00:12:27.266 - 00:12:30.566</b><br>tons of supporters and tons of sellers<br></p><p><b>00:12:30.566 - 00:12:32.166</b><br>tons of people that are against this thing<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.166 - 00:12:33.400</b><br>and tons of people that are for<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.400 - 00:12:34.133</b><br>this thing<br></p><p><b>00:12:34.133 - 00:12:36.333</b><br>and that's gonna make the chart bounce around<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.500 - 00:12:38.400</b><br>but it's also gonna be predictable<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.666 - 00:12:41.333</b><br>because if it bounces too far this way<br></p><p><b>00:12:41.500 - 00:12:42.000</b><br>then<br></p><p><b>00:12:42.000 - 00:12:43.666</b><br>people are gonna sell it back down<br></p><p><b>00:12:43.666 - 00:12:45.200</b><br>and if it bounces too far that way<br></p><p><b>00:12:45.200 - 00:12:47.000</b><br>then people are gonna buy it back up<br></p><p><b>00:12:47.266 - 00:12:50.533</b><br>so it makes it so that you can't lose money<br></p><p><b>00:12:50.766 - 00:12:52.566</b><br>but you got to find those charts<br></p><p><b>00:12:52.566 - 00:12:55.100</b><br>so your first step is to look for<br></p><p><b>00:12:55.466 - 00:12:56.700</b><br>a good argument<br></p><p><b>00:12:57.500 - 00:12:59.066</b><br>then your second step<br></p><p><b>00:13:00.000 - 00:13:02.766</b><br>is going to be read the story of the chart<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.166 - 00:13:05.066</b><br>so you're looking to see<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.066 - 00:13:07.500</b><br>what are your probabilities of success<br></p><p><b>00:13:07.800 - 00:13:10.966</b><br>so it takes me I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:13:11.500 - 00:13:14.133</b><br>30 seconds to read the story of the chart<br></p><p><b>00:13:14.133 - 00:13:15.400</b><br>so you'll get<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.400 - 00:13:17.100</b><br>good at this after a while and you'll be like<br></p><p><b>00:13:17.100 - 00:13:20.600</b><br>oh my goodness this chart is unbelievable and you can<br></p><p><b>00:13:20.666 - 00:13:22.700</b><br>if you read the story of the chart<br></p><p><b>00:13:22.766 - 00:13:26.100</b><br>you can literally trade that chart for months<br></p><p><b>00:13:26.533 - 00:13:28.333</b><br>and make money every day<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.333 - 00:13:31.266</b><br>or every second day or every third day<br></p><p><b>00:13:31.333 - 00:13:32.466</b><br>for months<br></p><p><b>00:13:32.466 - 00:13:34.600</b><br>and you'll be able to fill up<br></p><p><b>00:13:35.466 - 00:13:37.800</b><br>your this little side section<br></p><p><b>00:13:38.000 - 00:13:39.733</b><br>with all the charts<br></p><p><b>00:13:39.733 - 00:13:42.766</b><br>if you go to Polynex here look at all my charts<br></p><p><b>00:13:43.100 - 00:13:44.733</b><br>you can fill up this thing with<br></p><p><b>00:13:44.733 - 00:13:47.300</b><br>all the coins that you've read the charts<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.300 - 00:13:47.733</b><br>and you're like<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.733 - 00:13:49.733</b><br>oh man this is a good one to trade<br></p><p><b>00:13:49.933 - 00:13:51.366</b><br>so you can just woof<br></p><p><b>00:13:51.366 - 00:13:54.700</b><br>now not all of these are those type of<br></p><p><b>00:13:55.300 - 00:13:57.900</b><br>charts I didn't list this because of that<br></p><p><b>00:13:57.966 - 00:13:58.866</b><br>I listed this<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.866 - 00:14:01.400</b><br>because these are the ones that have a lot of volume<br></p><p><b>00:14:01.666 - 00:14:04.533</b><br>and so the first thing you're looking for step 1<br></p><p><b>00:14:04.800 - 00:14:06.300</b><br>was finding an argument<br></p><p><b>00:14:06.300 - 00:14:08.366</b><br>you're looking for stalks<br></p><p><b>00:14:08.366 - 00:14:10.800</b><br>where there's a lot of movement and a lot<br></p><p><b>00:14:10.800 - 00:14:12.466</b><br>of people involved<br></p><p><b>00:14:12.566 - 00:14:14.400</b><br>second step is<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.700 - 00:14:18.000</b><br>read the chart read the story<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.166 - 00:14:20.800</b><br>and so you're looking to find<br></p><p><b>00:14:21.200 - 00:14:24.133</b><br>whatever gives you high probabilities of your<br></p><p><b>00:14:24.600 - 00:14:25.900</b><br>trade becoming successful<br></p><p><b>00:14:25.900 - 00:14:27.500</b><br>I'm going to go through all this with you<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.866 - 00:14:30.333</b><br>individually but let's just go through the steps first<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.533 - 00:14:31.733</b><br>and then your third<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.800 - 00:14:35.000</b><br>your third is to set yourself alerts<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.066 - 00:14:35.866</b><br>so you<br></p><p><b>00:14:36.300 - 00:14:38.066</b><br>find stocks that are<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.066 - 00:14:40.733</b><br>that have a lot of argument that have a lot of volume<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.933 - 00:14:43.733</b><br>and then you read the thing and make sure that oh man<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.733 - 00:14:44.900</b><br>this is a good one to trade<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.900 - 00:14:46.733</b><br>it always always works out<br></p><p><b>00:14:47.066 - 00:14:47.966</b><br>every time<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.166 - 00:14:50.500</b><br>I would have taken a trade it would have worked out<br></p><p><b>00:14:50.700 - 00:14:52.566</b><br>so the probabilities are super high<br></p><p><b>00:14:52.966 - 00:14:55.400</b><br>and then the third thing is set alerts<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.400 - 00:14:59.333</b><br>go ahead with Kenigi it's super easy to set alerts<br></p><p><b>00:14:59.333 - 00:15:02.100</b><br>you just go right here to the alert tab and you type in<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.266 - 00:15:03.666</b><br>where you want an alert to be set<br></p><p><b>00:15:03.666 - 00:15:05.600</b><br>you can see all my alerts set up here<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.733 - 00:15:07.533</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.900 - 00:15:08.566</b><br>you just<br></p><p><b>00:15:08.566 - 00:15:09.600</b><br>plug in your alerts<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.600 - 00:15:11.466</b><br>in the spots that you would be buying<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.800 - 00:15:13.966</b><br>and then it will tell you when to buy<br></p><p><b>00:15:13.966 - 00:15:15.100</b><br>it'll be like ding ding ding<br></p><p><b>00:15:15.100 - 00:15:16.900</b><br>and you go and check and oh yeah<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.900 - 00:15:17.933</b><br>and boom you're in<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.333 - 00:15:19.866</b><br>those are your three steps<br></p><p><b>00:15:19.900 - 00:15:20.866</b><br>where do you sell<br></p><p><b>00:15:20.866 - 00:15:22.533</b><br>that is easy peasy<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.533 - 00:15:23.666</b><br>and I'll show you that too<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.766 - 00:15:25.533</b><br>so let's first start<br></p><p><b>00:15:25.600 - 00:15:27.866</b><br>I mean I can't think of a better chart to look at<br></p><p><b>00:15:27.966 - 00:15:28.900</b><br>than Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:15:29.266 - 00:15:33.366</b><br>ethereum is probably one of the best charts<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.500 - 00:15:35.700</b><br>to be buying and I'll tell you why<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.700 - 00:15:38.200</b><br>a theory is so awesome it's because<br></p><p><b>00:15:39.066 - 00:15:40.133</b><br>it's strong<br></p><p><b>00:15:40.266 - 00:15:41.366</b><br>there's lots and<br></p><p><b>00:15:41.366 - 00:15:42.933</b><br>lots of people involved<br></p><p><b>00:15:42.933 - 00:15:44.900</b><br>everybody's interested in the theory<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.200 - 00:15:48.800</b><br>you know they've got all kinds of d apps or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.866 - 00:15:49.333</b><br>all kinds of<br></p><p><b>00:15:49.333 - 00:15:52.266</b><br>programmers that are working on things to use the<br></p><p><b>00:15:52.266 - 00:15:54.466</b><br>Ethereum to work off of Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:15:54.666 - 00:15:58.133</b><br>so there's so many people involved in so many projects<br></p><p><b>00:15:58.266 - 00:16:00.266</b><br>that it's a big big deal<br></p><p><b>00:16:01.200 - 00:16:03.466</b><br>and then you you<br></p><p><b>00:16:03.466 - 00:16:05.866</b><br>you get the Dow that got hacked or whatever and<br></p><p><b>00:16:05.866 - 00:16:07.066</b><br>lost a bunch of money<br></p><p><b>00:16:07.066 - 00:16:08.500</b><br>you get these these<br></p><p><b>00:16:08.900 - 00:16:10.900</b><br>really bad things that happen that don't<br></p><p><b>00:16:10.900 - 00:16:11.900</b><br>that you know it's not<br></p><p><b>00:16:11.900 - 00:16:13.566</b><br>directly a theorems problem<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.933 - 00:16:17.266</b><br>but it's all these little apps on Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:16:17.400 - 00:16:18.600</b><br>that are running off<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.600 - 00:16:21.366</b><br>Ethereum that all of a sudden have all kinds of issues<br></p><p><b>00:16:21.366 - 00:16:22.066</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.066 - 00:16:24.366</b><br>lots of people hate Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:16:24.400 - 00:16:27.900</b><br>hate the Dow you know and there's haters<br></p><p><b>00:16:27.900 - 00:16:29.800</b><br>and then there's a ton of supporters<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.900 - 00:16:32.366</b><br>so you got a good base for an argument<br></p><p><b>00:16:32.366 - 00:16:34.933</b><br>and you're gonna see it on the chart it's gonna<br></p><p><b>00:16:34.933 - 00:16:37.100</b><br>be an awesome chart because of that<br></p><p><b>00:16:37.300 - 00:16:39.666</b><br>it's gonna be a chart that you can't lose money on<br></p><p><b>00:16:40.533 - 00:16:42.533</b><br>okay so let's take a look at the theorem chart<br></p><p><b>00:16:43.366 - 00:16:44.500</b><br>we're on a one hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:16:44.500 - 00:16:46.733</b><br>let's just make that a four hour for now<br></p><p><b>00:16:47.566 - 00:16:49.566</b><br>just so it's really easy to read<br></p><p><b>00:16:50.866 - 00:16:54.533</b><br>if it's something really hot like Ethereum then<br></p><p><b>00:16:54.566 - 00:16:54.933</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:16:54.933 - 00:16:56.866</b><br>it'll work on a one hour chart 2 and it'll work on a<br></p><p><b>00:16:56.866 - 00:16:58.400</b><br>15 minute chart and it'll work on a lot<br></p><p><b>00:16:58.400 - 00:17:00.533</b><br>of stuff because the argument is so thick<br></p><p><b>00:17:00.800 - 00:17:03.866</b><br>that it's just gonna be easier for demonstration<br></p><p><b>00:17:03.866 - 00:17:05.000</b><br>just to show you guys<br></p><p><b>00:17:05.300 - 00:17:07.266</b><br>how simple it is to read a chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:07.733 - 00:17:09.566</b><br>so I'm just gonna go to four hours for now<br></p><p><b>00:17:10.366 - 00:17:11.933</b><br>so you take a look at this chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:11.933 - 00:17:13.466</b><br>and you think to yourself<br></p><p><b>00:17:14.600 - 00:17:17.500</b><br>where are the arguments right so<br></p><p><b>00:17:17.566 - 00:17:18.566</b><br>when I say an argument<br></p><p><b>00:17:18.566 - 00:17:21.000</b><br>I'm saying that there's gonna be some clear support<br></p><p><b>00:17:21.000 - 00:17:21.933</b><br>and there's gonna be some<br></p><p><b>00:17:21.933 - 00:17:23.733</b><br>clear resistance on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:24.333 - 00:17:27.266</b><br>and so if you look at this chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:27.333 - 00:17:30.000</b><br>it's really easy to find support<br></p><p><b>00:17:30.133 - 00:17:31.333</b><br>support right there<br></p><p><b>00:17:31.333 - 00:17:34.466</b><br>and support right there and support right there right<br></p><p><b>00:17:34.500 - 00:17:36.666</b><br>now there's going to be little arguments on top of<br></p><p><b>00:17:36.666 - 00:17:38.200</b><br>the big arguments<br></p><p><b>00:17:38.266 - 00:17:40.300</b><br>you know this right there that's a little argument<br></p><p><b>00:17:40.300 - 00:17:40.866</b><br>this one<br></p><p><b>00:17:40.866 - 00:17:42.666</b><br>this little section right here is a little argument<br></p><p><b>00:17:42.666 - 00:17:43.966</b><br>and that's a little argument<br></p><p><b>00:17:44.000 - 00:17:45.900</b><br>so there's lots of little arguments<br></p><p><b>00:17:45.900 - 00:17:47.533</b><br>but there's also the big ones<br></p><p><b>00:17:47.533 - 00:17:49.900</b><br>so the big ones are always the safest<br></p><p><b>00:17:50.266 - 00:17:52.100</b><br>but you can play the little ones too<br></p><p><b>00:17:52.100 - 00:17:53.966</b><br>you can play the little ones you just have to be quick<br></p><p><b>00:17:53.966 - 00:17:55.666</b><br>you have to be like if you're gonna<br></p><p><b>00:17:55.966 - 00:17:57.500</b><br>work within a one hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:57.500 - 00:17:58.733</b><br>or if you're gonna work within a 15<br></p><p><b>00:17:58.733 - 00:18:00.166</b><br>minute chart then you have to<br></p><p><b>00:18:00.166 - 00:18:00.800</b><br>expect that<br></p><p><b>00:18:00.800 - 00:18:03.300</b><br>you have to make your moves within an hour or two<br></p><p><b>00:18:03.766 - 00:18:05.700</b><br>you know if you're gonna work on a four hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:18:05.800 - 00:18:09.100</b><br>then your moves are gonna happen over a few days<br></p><p><b>00:18:09.533 - 00:18:12.333</b><br>so it's just whatever you decide whatever chart frame<br></p><p><b>00:18:12.333 - 00:18:14.333</b><br>you're using to read from<br></p><p><b>00:18:14.766 -

00:18:37.866</b><br>when this happens when you get a panic drop like that<br></p><p><b>00:18:37.900 - 00:18:41.133</b><br>what you have is you have a surprise right so<br></p><p><b>00:18:41.400 - 00:18:43.400</b><br>right here everybody's supporting this<br></p><p><b>00:18:43.400 -

00:18:52.266</b><br>lots lots panic<br></p><p><b>00:18:52.333 - 00:18:53.400</b><br>not all of them<br></p><p><b>00:18:53.700 - 00:18:55.966</b><br>probably you know 50 percent of them panic<br></p><p><b>00:18:55.966 - 00:18:58.000</b><br>and start selling and selling and selling and selling<br></p><p><b>00:18:58.000 - 00:18:59.066</b><br>you get this dive<br></p><p><b>00:18:59.466 - 00:19:02.766</b><br>but the price comes back up to retest this support<br></p><p><b>00:19:03.300 - 00:19:04.100</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:19:05.100 - 00:19:05.900</b><br>eventually<br></p><p><b>00:19:05.900 - 00:19:08.266</b><br>these guys are gonna run out of stuff to sell<br></p><p><b>00:19:08.666 -

00:19:23.100</b><br>so what happens is stuffing<br></p><p><b>00:19:23.366 - 00:19:24.733</b><br>so again<br></p><p><b>00:19:25.466 - 00:19:27.266</b><br>I don't know if far chart is in the exact same<br></p><p><b>00:19:27.266 - 00:19:29.000</b><br>place because I touched it with my mouse but<br></p><p><b>00:19:30.466 - 00:19:33.166</b><br>around 2524 is your<br></p><p><b>00:19:33.366 - 00:19:36.466</b><br>base here and then it fell really hard and then<br></p><p><b>00:19:36.666 - 00:19:38.600</b><br>look at this little volume spike here<br></p><p><b>00:19:38.600 - 00:19:39.866</b><br>see how much volume<br></p><p><b>00:19:39.866 - 00:19:41.066</b><br>all of a sudden there is right here<br></p><p><b>00:19:41.066 - 00:19:43.000</b><br>it's going to be easier to read this on<br></p><p><b>00:19:43.066 - 00:19:45.133</b><br>a smaller chart like on the 1 hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:19:45.133 - 00:19:47.266</b><br>you'll see all of a sudden a whole bunch of volume<br></p><p><b>00:19:47.333 - 00:19:48.400</b><br>right near the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:19:48.400 - 00:19:49.600</b><br>and that's stuffing<br></p><p><b>00:19:49.666 - 00:19:51.133</b><br>that's like some serious<br></p><p><b>00:19:51.133 - 00:19:53.766</b><br>money comes in to support the price right there<br></p><p><b>00:19:53.966 - 00:19:56.300</b><br>and then based off of that<br></p><p><b>00:19:56.933 - 00:19:58.133</b><br>it can't go any further down<br></p><p><b>00:19:58.133 - 00:20:00.700</b><br>you know they buy up all the rest of the sellers<br></p><p><b>00:20:00.700 - 00:20:02.266</b><br>and then the thing turns<br></p><p><b>00:20:02.266 - 00:20:04.766</b><br>and people start to realize it's being supported<br></p><p><b>00:20:04.766 - 00:20:05.966</b><br>and everybody starts buying it<br></p><p><b>00:20:05.966 - 00:20:07.500</b><br>and then you bounce back up<br></p><p><b>00:20:07.500 - 00:20:09.000</b><br>but now when you're bouncing back up<br></p><p><b>00:20:09.000 - 00:20:10.400</b><br>you don't have sellers anymore<br></p><p><b>00:20:10.733 - 00:20:12.700</b><br>so there's nothing to stop it from going<br></p><p><b>00:20:12.700 - 00:20:14.133</b><br>all the way back to<br></p><p><b>00:20:14.266 - 00:20:16.066</b><br>where it was previously supported<br></p><p><b>00:20:16.800 - 00:20:18.366</b><br>so you get this nice bounce<br></p><p><b>00:20:18.466 - 00:20:20.500</b><br>so this is where you want to buy<br></p><p><b>00:20:20.500 - 00:20:23.100</b><br>you want to buy where the big money<br></p><p><b>00:20:23.566 - 00:20:25.200</b><br>just bought because<br></p><p><b>00:20:25.366 - 00:20:27.900</b><br>to stop this from having panic fall<br></p><p><b>00:20:27.900 - 00:20:29.466</b><br>it has to hit support<br></p><p><b>00:20:29.533 - 00:20:31.800</b><br>it has to hit big money<br></p><p><b>00:20:31.800 - 00:20:32.966</b><br>somebody who's got<br></p><p><b>00:20:32.966 - 00:20:35.600</b><br>or a bunch of people who have a lot of<br></p><p><b>00:20:37.133 - 00:20:39.700</b><br>bitcoin to spend to buy up ethereal<br></p><p><b>00:20:40.533 - 00:20:41.666</b><br>so right there<br></p><p><b>00:20:41.933 - 00:20:43.500</b><br>is where the money steps in<br></p><p><b>00:20:43.700 - 00:20:45.066</b><br>that's where you want to step in<br></p><p><b>00:20:45.066 - 00:20:46.800</b><br>and then you get this nice balance up<br></p><p><b>00:20:46.800 - 00:20:49.933</b><br>back up to previous support which is now resistance<br></p><p><b>00:20:50.500 - 00:20:51.300</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:20:51.533 - 00:20:52.400</b><br>eventually well<br></p><p><b>00:20:52.400 - 00:20:53.866</b><br>especially when it hits this right away<br></p><p><b>00:20:53.866 - 00:20:55.200</b><br>it wants to turn itself around<br></p><p><b>00:20:55.333 - 00:20:56.800</b><br>and it cracks again<br></p><p><b>00:20:56.966 - 00:21:00.166</b><br>and then another well you can't see it as clear<br></p><p><b>00:21:00.166 - 00:21:01.333</b><br>but a big chunk of<br></p><p><b>00:21:01.333 - 00:21:02.400</b><br>volume comes in right there<br></p><p><b>00:21:02.400 - 00:21:03.966</b><br>and supports the price again<br></p><p><b>00:21:04.500 - 00:21:06.533</b><br>and it bounces again and again<br></p><p><b>00:21:06.533 - 00:21:09.300</b><br>you get like we're talking about from 16<br></p><p><b>00:21:09.400 - 00:21:11.066</b><br>to 21 or 22<br></p><p><b>00:21:11.533 - 00:21:14.166</b><br>like really big percentages just beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:21:15.166 - 00:21:15.966</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:21:16.466 - 00:21:18.466</b><br>the next argument would be this part right<br></p><p><b>00:21:18.466 - 00:21:19.300</b><br>this is an argument<br></p><p><b>00:21:19.300 - 00:21:21.133</b><br>this is an argument this is an argument<br></p><p><b>00:21:21.133 - 00:21:23.166</b><br>and here's your here's your<br></p><p><b>00:21:23.933 - 00:21:25.066</b><br>resistance<br></p><p><b>00:21:25.533 - 00:21:28.166</b><br>where everybody thinks it shouldn't get past this price<br></p><p><b>00:21:28.166 - 00:21:30.700</b><br>it shouldn't get past this price and then boom<br></p><p><b>00:21:30.933 - 00:21:33.466</b><br>it surprises everybody and it goes past that price<br></p><p><b>00:21:33.466 - 00:21:34.700</b><br>but how long does it last<br></p><p><b>00:21:34.700 - 00:21:37.166</b><br>not very long before it comes all the way back down<br></p><p><b>00:21:37.266 - 00:21:40.100</b><br>and this is another swing of 23<br></p><p><b>00:21:40.600 - 00:21:45.333</b><br>to 34 you know huge swings comes right back down<br></p><p><b>00:21:46.466 - 00:21:48.966</b><br>so if you were shorting you can't short but<br></p><p><b>00:21:49.600 - 00:21:51.133</b><br>maybe you can if you have a margin account<br></p><p><b>00:21:51.133 - 00:21:54.200</b><br>but if you were shorting you would make money on this<br></p><p><b>00:21:54.700 - 00:21:56.300</b><br>and then here's your argument again<br></p><p><b>00:21:56.566 - 00:21:58.966</b><br>here's they're giving you some clear support<br></p><p><b>00:21:58.966 - 00:22:00.666</b><br>clear support clear support<br></p><p><b>00:22:00.800 - 00:22:02.266</b><br>they crack that support<br></p><p><b>00:22:02.333 - 00:22:04.733</b><br>now of course that was that Dow situation<br></p><p><b>00:22:04.733 - 00:22:06.200</b><br>but they crack that support<br></p><p><b>00:22:06.266 - 00:22:09.466</b><br>and they go all the way from 22<br></p><p><b>00:22:10.066 - 00:22:12.300</b><br>all the way down to 7<br></p><p><b>00:22:12.700 - 00:22:15.366</b><br>22 to 7 you came and see it on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:22:15.366 - 00:22:17.600</b><br>and look at the volume step in<br></p><p><b>00:22:18.566 - 00:22:20.400</b><br>so I mean<br></p><p><b>00:22:20.600 - 00:22:22.900</b><br>you can't get a clearer chart than that<br></p><p><b>00:22:23.100 - 00:22:24.400</b><br>and then from 7<br></p><p><b>00:22:24.400 - 00:22:27.533</b><br>all the way back up to 23 on that bounce<br></p><p><b>00:22:27.866 - 00:22:28.666</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:22:29.100 - 00:22:31.666</b><br>this is where people are panicking<br></p><p><b>00:22:32.100 - 00:22:33.900</b><br>and when people are panicking<br></p><p><b>00:22:33.966 - 00:22:34.666</b><br>that's your<br></p><p><b>00:22:34.666 - 00:22:35.766</b><br>optimum place<br></p><p><b>00:22:35.933 - 00:22:38.600</b><br>to be buying that's your highest probability tree<br></p><p><b>00:22:38.900 - 00:22:40.866</b><br>especially if you can watch<br></p><p><b>00:22:40.933 - 00:22:43.766</b><br>and catch it right when support steps in<br></p><p><b>00:22:43.866 - 00:22:45.266</b><br>when you start to see really<br></p><p><b>00:22:45.266 - 00:22:47.133</b><br>really big orders going through<br></p><p><b>00:22:47.366 - 00:22:48.566</b><br>then you know that<br></p><p><b>00:22:48.700 - 00:22:49.666</b><br>somebody is<br></p><p><b>00:22:49.666 - 00:22:52.733</b><br>stuffing and supporting that price at that point<br></p><p><b>00:22:52.800 - 00:22:54.466</b><br>and just taking up all<br></p><p><b>00:22:54.666 - 00:22:56.900</b><br>of the buyers that are panicking all of them all<br></p><p><b>00:22:56.900 - 00:22:59.566</b><br>at once and that happened around the 7th section<br></p><p><b>00:23:00.566 - 00:23:02.100</b><br>then you add that nice big bounce<br></p><p><b>00:23:02.300 - 00:23:03.200</b><br>and then now<br></p><p><b>00:23:04.333 - 00:23:06.700</b><br>back into very small arguments<br></p><p><b>00:23:06.700 -

00:23:14.300</b><br>our argument and a<br></p><p><b>00:23:14.300 - 00:23:18.066</b><br>crack of the argument and a balance right back up and<br></p><p><b>00:23:18.266 - 00:23:19.066</b><br>it just<br></p><p><b>00:23:19.800 -

00:27:50.300</b><br>first<br></p><p><b>00:27:50.300 - 00:27:52.366</b><br>you're looking for an argument you're looking for<br></p><p><b>00:27:52.400 - 00:27:53.866</b><br>a well supported<br></p><p><b>00:27:53.900 -
