00:00:06.100</b><br>it is Wednesday and it's a little bit slow right now<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.266 - 00:00:08.066</b><br>things are turning around a bit in<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.700 - 00:00:10.866</b><br>cryptose so I just want to discuss that with you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.866 - 00:00:11.800</b><br>for a quick second<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.900 - 00:00:12.966</b><br>I just thought I'd take a<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.000 - 00:00:14.966</b><br>few minutes out of my day just to make a quick video<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.666 - 00:00:16.533</b><br>somebody<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.966 - 00:00:18.666</b><br>steam it and you know who you are<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.000 - 00:00:23.166</b><br>recorded all my old videos from my old YouTube channel<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.700 - 00:00:25.800</b><br>which is so nice to get those back<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.566 - 00:00:28.766</b><br>so that person was kind enough to<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.966 - 00:00:31.266</b><br>allow me to download all my old videos<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.733 - 00:00:33.733</b><br>so I'm going through those videos now<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.933 - 00:00:35.533</b><br>just to make sure that there's nothing<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.533 - 00:00:36.733</b><br>that would compromise<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.000 - 00:00:39.200</b><br>my security since obviously<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.200 - 00:00:39.966</b><br>you all know that<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.966 - 00:00:42.266</b><br>I've had a little bit of internet security issue before<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.400 - 00:00:45.000</b><br>so I'm gonna go revisit those videos and make sure<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.566 - 00:00:47.166</b><br>everything's on the up and up but<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.500 - 00:00:49.000</b><br>if everything is cool I'm going to start<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.000 - 00:00:50.166</b><br>reposting them back<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.166 - 00:00:52.933</b><br>or at least give the links put them back on my new<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.366 - 00:00:55.533</b><br>YouTube channel so that everybody can go back<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.533 - 00:00:58.000</b><br>in time and look at those videos<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.000 - 00:01:00.966</b><br>so the very first one I just just watched right now<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.366 - 00:01:02.166</b><br>was<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.000 - 00:01:05.366</b><br>the Holy Grail is there a holy grail<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.500 - 00:01:06.600</b><br>trading system out there<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.533 - 00:01:10.000</b><br>so I watched that one it's totally fine<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.066 - 00:01:12.133</b><br>you're gonna love that Ethereum was at<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.133 - 00:01:14.133</b><br>11 dollars in that video<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.266 - 00:01:17.066</b><br>anyway so I was going through<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.400 - 00:01:19.566</b><br>the Ethereum chart and explaining<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.600 - 00:01:22.266</b><br>you know how to look for an argument and how<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.400 - 00:01:23.266</b><br>to draw your<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.533 - 00:01:26.266</b><br>your support and your resistance zones<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.266 - 00:01:28.400</b><br>and when a crack happens and a panic happens<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.400 - 00:01:29.333</b><br>and basically the same<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.333 - 00:01:31.100</b><br>stuff that I'm going over with you guys<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.133 - 00:01:32.133</b><br>in the videos now<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.900 - 00:01:36.466</b><br>maybe a little more basic back then where I was just<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.066 - 00:01:39.566</b><br>explaining how a market is made<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.666 - 00:01:41.400</b><br>and what the different players<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.400 - 00:01:42.600</b><br>in stock market are you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.600 - 00:01:44.900</b><br>the market makers and institutional players<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.900 - 00:01:45.700</b><br>and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.566 - 00:01:48.300</b><br>so I was going through that a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.300 - 00:01:49.800</b><br>what the bid in the ask was<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.166 - 00:01:52.966</b><br>kind of the basics but anyway I'm going to<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.200 - 00:01:55.666</b><br>post that right after this video<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.133 - 00:01:58.600</b><br>I'll put both of those on my new YouTube channel<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.600 - 00:02:01.733</b><br>and I will link them both here in the STEMIC blog<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.466 - 00:02:05.866</b><br>so anyway just to show you what's been happening<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.566 - 00:02:08.933</b><br>I just wanted to update you on<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.933 - 00:02:10.900</b><br>Strat because I've been buying some Strat<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.266 - 00:02:13.600</b><br>I got in over here on this one and<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.600 - 00:02:15.133</b><br>didn't really sell any of it because it<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.133 - 00:02:16.400</b><br>never returned to his base<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.400 - 00:02:18.733</b><br>which told me that this is getting very weak<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.700 - 00:02:22.866</b><br>so when a stock gets very weak like this and you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.866 - 00:02:25.000</b><br>all of a sudden it cracked<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.166 - 00:02:26.966</b><br>let's grab ourselves a marker here<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.666 - 00:02:30.300</b><br>all of a sudden it cracked right here this next base<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.566 - 00:02:32.733</b><br>so it this was the first base<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.733 - 00:02:34.800</b><br>we never got to bounce back to base<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.800 - 00:02:36.200</b><br>so that's showing extreme weakness<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.200 - 00:02:36.600</b><br>of course<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.600 - 00:02:38.200</b><br>that doesn't have to do a Strat that just has<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.200 - 00:02:39.133</b><br>to do with the market was<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.133 - 00:02:40.266</b><br>crashing right then<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.766 - 00:02:43.100</b><br>you know everything was going down including Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.900 - 00:02:45.066</b><br>so that caused this to<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.066 - 00:02:47.800</b><br>and stride is one of those ethereum like projects<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.933 - 00:02:50.466</b><br>so that caused this to really take a hit so<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.500 - 00:02:52.400</b><br>on this crack I got in right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.400 - 00:02:54.666</b><br>and got in here and got in here<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.000 - 00:02:56.666</b><br>and we got this nice bounce<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.666 - 00:02:58.533</b><br>all the way back up to the base<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.533 - 00:03:00.300</b><br>which I didn't participate in<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.766 - 00:03:02.666</b><br>I think I was sleeping at that point<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.666 - 00:03:05.100</b><br>so I just wasn't around to be watching it<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.566 - 00:03:08.900</b><br>otherwise I would have sold some on this bounce<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.366 - 00:03:10.100</b><br>so that you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.100 - 00:03:12.400</b><br>I make a little bit of profit and it kind of<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.400 - 00:03:13.733</b><br>erases what happened there<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.600 - 00:03:16.533</b><br>you know because that was a pretty<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.600 - 00:03:18.800</b><br>good size trade that I took there<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.866 - 00:03:21.733</b><br>and then this one was about the same amount of money<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.733 - 00:03:24.600</b><br>and then finally I got in some really thick ones here<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.933 - 00:03:26.400</b><br>so anyway I just<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.733 - 00:03:27.533</b><br>cut out<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.933 - 00:03:29.066</b><br>I'll call this brake even<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.066 - 00:03:31.100</b><br>maybe there was a little bit of profit in this but<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.166 - 00:03:32.100</b><br>I'll call this brake even<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.100 - 00:03:34.500</b><br>so I cut out half of my position right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.700 - 00:03:35.900</b><br>so I'm still expecting<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.900 - 00:03:37.533</b><br>obviously a good bounce out of this<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.866 - 00:03:39.566</b><br>but just to be on the safe side of things<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.566 - 00:03:40.733</b><br>because everything's kind of<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.733 - 00:03:41.800</b><br>sketchy right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.300 - 00:03:45.100</b><br>I decided to and I've had so many good trades<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.800 - 00:03:47.000</b><br>I decided to<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.966 - 00:03:48.966</b><br>take half<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.666 - 00:03:51.333</b><br>my position off a brake even on that<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.966 - 00:03:54.066</b><br>if you've been watching my steam it blog<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.300 - 00:03:58.066</b><br>you'll see that what I did yesterday was I posted<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.200 - 00:04:00.266</b><br>a whole bunch of traits that I took<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.366 - 00:04:01.766</b><br>and explained them all<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.766 - 00:04:03.700</b><br>you know like of course starting with ether<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.400 - 00:04:07.200</b><br>you know explained where I got in and where I got out<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.200 - 00:04:08.000</b><br>and where I got out<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.066 - 00:04:11.100</b><br>look at this beautiful trade on bats<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.200 - 00:04:13.466</b><br>and on BSD and so forth and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.466 - 00:04:14.700</b><br>so you can go visit my<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.100 - 00:04:18.300</b><br>my blog if you want to go and just take a look<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.300 - 00:04:19.966</b><br>and then of course there was some that I missed<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.966 - 00:04:22.300</b><br>what gorgeous ones that I missed way down here<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.300 - 00:04:25.300</b><br>mistrades on dash look at that a<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.266 - 00:04:27.066</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.566 - 00:04:28.466</b><br>XMR<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.900 - 00:04:30.766</b><br>what dive all the way down to 15<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.766 - 00:04:32.366</b><br>all the way back up to 1650<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.800 - 00:04:35.966</b><br>anyway there's a bunch so<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.400 - 00:04:39.200</b><br>let me just put that away<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.466 - 00:04:40.533</b><br>and then a theorem<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.533 - 00:04:41.766</b><br>let's just go visit a theorem really<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.766 - 00:04:43.166</b><br>quick before I let you guys go<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.166 - 00:04:44.733</b><br>because I got to get back to trading<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.333 - 00:04:46.566</b><br>a theorem USD<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.900 - 00:04:48.700</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.333 - 00:04:52.000</b><br>if we just blow this up a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.266 - 00:04:54.666</b><br>we all know that 200 was the major base right<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.666 - 00:04:57.000</b><br>right here 200 was the major base<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.466 - 00:05:02.733</b><br>so you know that was the major base<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.733 - 00:05:04.300</b><br>this was the baby base<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.300 - 00:05:06.366</b><br>so this looks a lot like Strat doesn't it<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.566 - 00:05:07.500</b><br>you know where<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.700 - 00:05:09.133</b><br>it cracks a base<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.133 - 00:05:11.500</b><br>it bounces and doesn't get quite back up<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.500 - 00:05:13.133</b><br>well in this case because it's Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.133 - 00:05:15.866</b><br>it got very very close but then<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.933 - 00:05:19.933</b><br>but then the major bases right here when it cracks that<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.966 - 00:05:22.733</b><br>and you'll see my BIS look very identical you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.700 - 00:05:25.900</b><br>but anyway I got this initial crack<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.900 - 00:05:27.466</b><br>which was great all the way to<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.500 - 00:05:29.533</b><br>I don't know what it was 185 or something<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.666 - 00:05:32.100</b><br>and then sold back up here at 2<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.166 - 00:05:33.800</b><br>11 and then I got<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.900 - 00:05:35.466</b><br>the next crack all the way down<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.466 - 00:05:37.466</b><br>so let's just draw that other one right here<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.733 - 00:05:40.100</b><br>so I got the next crack all the way down to 175<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.100 - 00:05:41.566</b><br>I was sleeping at that point<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.900 - 00:05:43.800</b><br>on the bounce I sold right here<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.100 - 00:05:45.700</b><br>and then I took a nibble here<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.966 - 00:05:48.933</b><br>because you know we're back underneath the 200<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.866 - 00:05:52.766</b><br>major base you know I'm hoping for that one 70<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.766 - 00:05:54.700</b><br>crack I don't know if that's gonna happen<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.700 - 00:05:57.466</b><br>but of course I'm hoping for the one 70 crack<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.466 - 00:06:00.333</b><br>I'd love to get one 30s one twenties one tens yeah<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.333 - 00:06:01.133</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:06:01.133 - 00:06:02.533</b><br>would be so awesome but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.900 -

00:12:17.400</b><br>you didn't really get a bounce off of that<br></p><p><b>00:12:17.500 - 00:12:20.166</b><br>so I wouldn't take this trade even though it worked<br></p><p><b>00:12:20.933 - 00:12:21.566</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:12:21.566 - 00:12:23.966</b><br>but meanwhile if you go back in time<br></p><p><b>00:12:24.766 - 00:12:26.500</b><br>and you look at the big picture<br></p><p><b>00:12:26.500 - 00:12:29.166</b><br>you wouldn't call that a bass anymore like that<br></p><p><b>00:12:29.800 - 00:12:31.766</b><br>would not even be something that you'd<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.266 - 00:12:33.600</b><br>consider a base<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.800 - 00:12:36.700</b><br>because you'd see what a real bounce looks like<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.700 - 00:12:38.066</b><br>oh a bounce is about<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.100 - 00:12:38.666</b><br>this<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.666 - 00:12:43.666</b><br>much and a bounce is about this much you know so<br></p><p><b>00:12:43.966 - 00:12:46.666</b><br>this could maybe be a base right here<br></p><p><b>00:12:46.666 - 00:12:48.500</b><br>but it's not really as much as that<br></p><p><b>00:12:48.733 - 00:12:51.266</b><br>it's definitely not as much as that<br></p><p><b>00:12:51.300 - 00:12:52.933</b><br>and it's definitely not as much as that<br></p><p><b>00:12:52.933 - 00:12:54.333</b><br>and so on so forth right<br></p><p><b>00:12:54.400 - 00:12:56.700</b><br>and the other thing is what's a crack<br></p><p><b>00:12:56.966 - 00:12:58.500</b><br>what's a crack of the base<br></p><p><b>00:12:58.500 - 00:13:01.133</b><br>well look how long that crack was<br></p><p><b>00:13:01.266 - 00:13:02.000</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:13:02.000 - 00:13:03.700</b><br>and then look how long<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.700 - 00:13:04.900</b><br>that crack was<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.000 - 00:13:07.566</b><br>and then look how long that crack was<br></p><p><b>00:13:07.900 - 00:13:09.166</b><br>and look how long<br></p><p><b>00:13:09.200 - 00:13:10.166</b><br>that crack was<br></p><p><b>00:13:10.200 - 00:13:12.900</b><br>so you can start to see where you want to get in<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.900 - 00:13:15.366</b><br>you're like well you know this was a crazy long crack<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.366 - 00:13:17.666</b><br>but look at that bounce you got off of it right<br></p><p><b>00:13:18.133 - 00:13:21.300</b><br>so this seems like about the average crack<br></p><p><b>00:13:22.066 - 00:13:24.300</b><br>and this seems like about the average crack<br></p><p><b>00:13:24.300 - 00:13:26.600</b><br>so I'd want to get in maybe right here<br></p><p><b>00:13:26.800 - 00:13:28.166</b><br>because that's about the average crack<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.166 - 00:13:30.000</b><br>or maybe even just at least start here<br></p><p><b>00:13:30.500 - 00:13:31.466</b><br>and then over here<br></p><p><b>00:13:31.466 - 00:13:33.200</b><br>oh well you know where I got it<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.200 - 00:13:34.066</b><br>where I started getting in<br></p><p><b>00:13:34.066 - 00:13:35.800</b><br>a little bit there and a little bit there<br></p><p><b>00:13:35.800 - 00:13:36.600</b><br>a little bit there<br></p><p><b>00:13:37.200 - 00:13:39.266</b><br>so anyway it just gives you<br></p><p><b>00:13:39.366 - 00:13:41.366</b><br>you have to see a bigger picture<br></p><p><b>00:13:41.566 - 00:13:44.300</b><br>to really get a frame of the way<br></p><p><b>00:13:44.466 - 00:13:46.600</b><br>this particular coin acts<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.266 - 00:13:48.666</b><br>so anyway that's something to keep in mind<br></p><p><b>00:13:48.666 - 00:13:49.500</b><br>I'm going to let you go<br></p><p><b>00:13:49.500 - 00:13:52.366</b><br>I got to get back before all my alarm strike going off<br></p></body></html>
