00:02:27.566</b><br>because I love it<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.666 - 00:02:28.466</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.533 - 00:02:30.200</b><br>I'm<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.200 - 00:02:34.533</b><br>it's 1154 and I'm up 500 dollars on a day so far<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.600 - 00:02:37.466</b><br>so that's like in the past two and a half hours<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.666 - 00:02:39.700</b><br>so there's really good money to be made<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.933 - 00:02:42.100</b><br>and after you've been doing it for 14 years<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.100 - 00:02:43.566</b><br>it's really easy<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.333 - 00:02:47.400</b><br>but it's extremely dangerous<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.666 - 00:02:49.166</b><br>and you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.166 - 00:02:51.800</b><br>my friends and family that I have tried to help<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.933 - 00:02:53.466</b><br>learn how to trade this<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.733 - 00:02:54.933</b><br>have lost their money<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.266 - 00:02:57.866</b><br>like I've actually had people sitting next to me in my<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.866 - 00:02:58.600</b><br>office<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.600 - 00:03:00.266</b><br>giving them one on one<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.300 -

00:03:09.300</b><br>they end up losing money<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.766 - 00:03:11.933</b><br>because it's so<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.066 - 00:03:15.300</b><br>dangerous and risky and things change so fast<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.300 - 00:03:17.300</b><br>and you have to adapt so fast<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.300 - 00:03:18.866</b><br>it's not the same environment<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.866 - 00:03:20.766</b><br>as it is in cryptocurrencies<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.466 - 00:03:23.933</b><br>it's a much much more dangerous environment<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.133 - 00:03:25.400</b><br>like take a look at this<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.466 - 00:03:27.600</b><br>this is a great example from just this morning<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.800 - 00:03:30.600</b><br>you know we're sitting at a dollar 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.600 - 00:03:32.733</b><br>and you can trade back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.733 - 00:03:34.100</b><br>back and forth up here<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.133 - 00:03:36.000</b><br>you can day trade this all you like<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.300 - 00:03:38.166</b><br>from a dollar 10 to a dollar 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.166 - 00:03:40.900</b><br>from a dollar 5 to a dollar 15<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.966 - 00:03:42.366</b><br>and then all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.966 - 00:03:46.366</b><br>bought red bar after red bar after red bar<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.366 - 00:03:47.066</b><br>after red bar<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.066 - 00:03:48.733</b><br>and if we go down to one day<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.966 - 00:03:50.766</b><br>I mean<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.466 - 00:03:53.800</b><br>okay there was a bounce here from 30<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.600 - 00:03:56.566</b><br>since up to 45 cents<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.566 - 00:03:58.666</b><br>you would have said that's just fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.666 - 00:04:00.066</b><br>but the only way<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.333 - 00:04:03.466</b><br>to understand this and to catch this and to not get<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.466 - 00:04:04.733</b><br>stuck in all of that<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.066 - 00:04:06.066</b><br>would be to<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.366 - 00:04:08.900</b><br>understand level 2 really really well<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.400 - 00:04:11.766</b><br>anyway<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.766 - 00:04:14.866</b><br>my point is that the danger is extremely high<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.333 - 00:04:17.500</b><br>you know there is the danger<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.533 - 00:04:19.533</b><br>that you could be day trading this thing<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.066 - 00:04:21.166</b><br>and have<br></p><p><b>00:04:21.266 - 00:04:25.533</b><br>a position of let's say $1,000 turn into 300 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.766 - 00:04:28.300</b><br>like a major major loss<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.766 - 00:04:31.333</b><br>and then you can compound that by layering<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.366 - 00:04:31.566</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.566 - 00:04:34.300</b><br>you could be trying to layer into some of these trades<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.333 - 00:04:36.900</b><br>and end up bigger and bigger size and bigger size<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.900 - 00:04:38.200</b><br>and turn that<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.200 - 00:04:40.933</b><br>whatever would have been 700 dollar loss into like<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.300 - 00:04:43.933</b><br>a 3,000 dollar loss or a 5,000 dollar loss<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.933 - 00:04:46.600</b><br>just by layering and not getting the bounces that you<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.600 - 00:04:47.766</b><br>were expecting to get<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.533 - 00:04:51.533</b><br>anyway the point is I can't teach this stuff<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.533 - 00:04:54.333</b><br>I can't teach daytrading<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.800 - 00:04:57.266</b><br>penny stocks it's very risky and I can't teach it<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.266 - 00:04:58.666</b><br>I've<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.666 - 00:05:02.100</b><br>really put my heart and soul into some of the students<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.100 - 00:05:05.200</b><br>and had them sit in my office with me to teach them<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.566 - 00:05:07.133</b><br>giving them all this one on one<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.766 - 00:05:09.666</b><br>and I feel<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.733 - 00:05:11.200</b><br>fantastic when I see them<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.200 - 00:05:13.466</b><br>succeeding and they're making lots of money<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.466 - 00:05:14.800</b><br>and then bang<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.900 - 00:05:16.333</b><br>they lose their whole account<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.866 - 00:05:18.000</b><br>and it kills me<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.400 - 00:05:19.800</b><br>I can't do that to people<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.300 - 00:05:22.700</b><br>so the only way<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.900 - 00:05:25.700</b><br>I can make videos and help people<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.900 - 00:05:28.000</b><br>is if I teach them the safest<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.566 - 00:05:29.533</b><br>way to trade<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.733 - 00:05:32.166</b><br>the easiest and safest way to trade<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.600 - 00:05:35.600</b><br>we have a gift here with cryptocurrency<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.600 - 00:05:39.533</b><br>we have a market that is extremely forgiving<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.733 - 00:05:40.900</b><br>to the point where<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.933 - 00:05:43.666</b><br>if you follow simple basic rules<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.000 - 00:05:48.666</b><br>you almost never lose a trade I I mean I<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.666 - 00:05:50.400</b><br>can't think of the last trade I lost<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.400 - 00:05:52.333</b><br>and I know that it was months ago<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.700 - 00:05:54.133</b><br>there was one but<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.566 -

00:06:10.100</b><br>okay so to get back on topic<br></p><p><b>00:06:11.466 - 00:06:12.533</b><br>there's a group of people<br></p><p><b>00:06:13.266 - 00:06:14.700</b><br>that are upset<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.700 -

00:09:32.500</b><br>and you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.100 - 00:09:36.900</b><br>we're looking at from a penny from point 01<br></p><p><b>00:09:37.600 - 00:09:40.066</b><br>all the way up to 50 cents at one point<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.466 - 00:09:44.400</b><br>but you know from a penny to like 15<br></p><p><b>00:09:44.400 - 00:09:45.900</b><br>cents is where we're at today<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.000 - 00:09:48.500</b><br>and it doesn't look that whippy<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.500 - 00:09:50.300</b><br>when you're looking at a four hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:09:50.333 - 00:09:53.533</b><br>but in reality it was crazy whippy<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.600 - 00:09:55.200</b><br>and this is where I got started<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.200 - 00:09:57.500</b><br>so I got started in November<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.933 - 00:09:59.733</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.100 - 00:10:01.900</b><br>here<br></p><p><b>00:10:02.866 - 00:10:05.900</b><br>that's where I noticed it and that's where I started<br></p><p><b>00:10:05.900 - 00:10:09.333</b><br>to trade it and when I started to trade it right there<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.500 - 00:10:10.933</b><br>I looked into Mana<br></p><p><b>00:10:10.933 - 00:10:12.566</b><br>like I was looking at the whippiness<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.566 - 00:10:14.900</b><br>so here let me go down to a one hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:10:17.000 - 00:10:18.166</b><br>now we have to back up<br></p><p><b>00:10:18.166 - 00:10:18.966</b><br>whoops<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.733 -

00:10:30.733</b><br>circle should be right here<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.500 - 00:10:32.700</b><br>this is a boat where I started<br></p><p><b>00:10:32.700 - 00:10:34.800</b><br>I don't know maybe the circle deleted<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.266 - 00:10:37.766</b><br>anyway this is where I got started<br></p><p><b>00:10:38.300 - 00:10:39.333</b><br>and you can see<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.366 - 00:10:41.733</b><br>just how crazy wippy it was<br></p><p><b>00:10:41.866 - 00:10:43.333</b><br>now it would have been awesome<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.333 - 00:10:45.466</b><br>to have gotten started at a penny down here<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.500 - 00:10:49.200</b><br>and had it gone all the way up to 20 cents and made<br></p><p><b>00:10:49.200 -

00:10:57.466</b><br>right in this section and<br></p><p><b>00:10:58.133 - 00:10:59.200</b><br>I looked at Mana<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.733 - 00:11:02.000</b><br>and found out that it was a utility coin<br></p><p><b>00:11:02.200 - 00:11:03.966</b><br>oh sorry just a second in the market<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.333 - 00:11:06.366</b><br>boy it's hard to make videos while I'm trading<br></p><p><b>00:11:07.100 - 00:11:08.133</b><br>okay so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.100 - 00:11:11.700</b><br>found out that it was a utility coin<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.800 - 00:11:14.066</b><br>that there's a place called the Central Land<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.066 - 00:11:15.700</b><br>and Mana is used<br></p><p><b>00:11:15.800 -

00:11:21.733</b><br>just continually show up<br></p><p><b>00:11:21.733 - 00:11:22.666</b><br>just that<br></p><p><b>00:11:22.700 - 00:11:24.000</b><br>they're not traders<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.200 - 00:11:26.333</b><br>but they just show up to buy<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.366 - 00:11:29.133</b><br>Mana to use on that platform<br></p><p><b>00:11:30.133 - 00:11:32.600</b><br>so that's going to make for spikes all the time<br></p><p><b>00:11:32.600 - 00:11:33.566</b><br>because there'll be<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.566 -

00:11:51.766</b><br>10,000 mana to go and buy some land or to<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.766 - 00:11:54.300</b><br>perform some function within this<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.766 - 00:11:55.666</b><br>ecosystem<br></p><p><b>00:11:56.000 - 00:11:57.500</b><br>so it's a utility coin<br></p><p><b>00:11:58.666 - 00:12:00.900</b><br>so this is where I started picking it up<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.900 - 00:12:02.800</b><br>I was buying sevens and selling<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.800 -

00:12:16.700</b><br>you are<br></p><p><b>00:12:17.466 - 00:12:19.400</b><br>keeping your amounts the same<br></p><p><b>00:12:19.400 - 00:12:22.266</b><br>although there was quite a bit of volume in this<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.966 - 00:12:24.766</b><br>you're basically keeping your amounts the same<br></p><p><b>00:12:24.766 - 00:12:27.566</b><br>so if I was buying 300 dollars over here<br></p><p><b>00:12:27.666 - 00:12:29.800</b><br>then you know maybe I'd be selling it and making<br></p><p><b>00:12:30.666 - 00:12:32.666</b><br>120 or 200 dollars or something<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.800 - 00:12:35.766</b><br>and then I'd be back buying 300 dollars worth and then<br></p><p><b>00:12:35.766 - 00:12:37.466</b><br>after a few trades<br></p><p><b>00:12:37.733 -

00:15:18.000</b><br>so the question I often get from you guys is<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.066 - 00:15:19.600</b><br>what happens when this thing starts to<br></p><p><b>00:15:19.600 - 00:15:20.666</b><br>dwindle and go lower<br></p><p><b>00:15:20.666 - 00:15:22.933</b><br>you know the volume kind of slows down a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.933 - 00:15:24.266</b><br>and then it starts to go down<br></p><p><b>00:15:24.266 - 00:15:25.500</b><br>and maybe you were working<br></p><p><b>00:15:25.500 -

00:15:35.366</b><br>things have changed and it starts heading low<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.766 - 00:15:36.333</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:15:36.333 - 00:15:38.766</b><br>you just you got to you got to<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.800 -

00:15:46.166</b><br>you're probably<br></p><p><b>00:15:46.166 - 00:15:50.533</b><br>up about 15 or 2000 dollars on your $300<br></p><p><b>00:15:50.700 - 00:15:52.366</b><br>you have no risk<br></p><p><b>00:15:52.933 -

00:16:06.733</b><br>that's all your doing<br></p><p><b>00:16:06.900 - 00:16:09.300</b><br>because you understand that's a utility coin and you<br></p><p><b>00:16:09.300 - 00:16:10.966</b><br>understand that it's gonna keep spiking<br></p><p><b>00:16:11.500 - 00:16:13.100</b><br>so I just adjust<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.600 - 00:16:14.400</b><br>my<br></p><p><b>00:16:14.500 - 00:16:17.800</b><br>range and now I'm working from 14 to 20<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.100 - 00:16:21.133</b><br>which is still extremely high percentages<br></p><p><b>00:16:21.700 - 00:16:23.133</b><br>and see it goes down<br></p><p><b>00:16:23.600 - 00:16:25.100</b><br>so then I'm working from<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.133 - 00:16:27.933</b><br>back down to like 8 cents to like 15<br></p><p><b>00:16:28.200 - 00:16:30.666</b><br>you know that's where I'm putting my layers in<br></p><p><b>00:16:30.966 - 00:16:31.800</b><br>and we get this<br></p><p><b>00:16:31.800 - 00:16:34.766</b><br>big bounce all the way back up to almost 20<br></p><p><b>00:16:34.866 - 00:16:36.900</b><br>and that clears all the layers<br></p><p><b>00:16:36.900 - 00:16:39.366</b><br>I might have developed in here that didn't<br></p><p><b>00:16:39.533 - 00:16:42.166</b><br>get filled so while I'm picking it up here<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.166 - 00:16:43.000</b><br>and I'm picking it up here<br></p><p><b>00:16:43.000 - 00:16:43.933</b><br>and picking up here<br></p><p><b>00:16:44.266 - 00:16:47.266</b><br>I'm sticking layers in as I'm buying it<br></p><p><b>00:16:47.366 - 00:16:50.000</b><br>I'm sticking layers in somewhere where my brake even is<br></p><p><b>00:16:50.000 - 00:16:51.866</b><br>and then everywhere up<br></p><p><b>00:16:52.600 - 00:16:54.133</b><br>then we get a nice big spike like that<br></p><p><b>00:16:54.133 - 00:16:55.966</b><br>and it clears all those layers almost<br></p><p><b>00:16:56.166 - 00:16:59.133</b><br>and also ends up with me with a bunch of free<br></p><p><b>00:17:00.333 - 00:17:00.900</b><br>mana<br></p><p><b>00:17:00.900 - 00:17:03.566</b><br>and then I'm back waiting for my next chance to get in<br></p><p><b>00:17:03.566 - 00:17:05.333</b><br>300 again like to get in<br></p><p><b>00:17:05.466 - 00:17:05.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:17:05.900 - 00:17:08.533</b><br>100 dollar layers or 50 dollar layers or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:17:08.533 - 00:17:09.600</b><br>I was doing back then<br></p><p><b>00:17:09.600 - 00:17:10.400</b><br>at that point<br></p><p><b>00:17:11.133 - 00:17:14.500</b><br>anyway then we continue going in the whippiness kind of<br></p><p><b>00:17:14.566 - 00:17:16.066</b><br>dies down a little bit here<br></p><p><b>00:17:16.466 - 00:17:17.966</b><br>so for a while there<br></p><p><b>00:17:18.200 - 00:17:21.766</b><br>I mean we're still looking at from 12 to 15 12 to 16<br></p><p><b>00:17:21.766 - 00:17:23.000</b><br>it's still really good<br></p><p><b>00:17:23.200 - 00:17:24.566</b><br>but I remember<br></p><p><b>00:17:24.566 - 00:17:27.333</b><br>even I was starting to slow down on not taking as many<br></p><p><b>00:17:27.333 - 00:17:28.266</b><br>trades on this<br></p><p><b>00:17:28.600 - 00:17:30.966</b><br>but look at the whippiness still keeps going from<br></p><p><b>00:17:30.966 - 00:17:33.700</b><br>11 to 15 these percentages are still really good<br></p><p><b>00:17:33.766 - 00:17:35.566</b><br>then another spike to 20<br></p><p><b>00:17:36.166 - 00:17:38.666</b><br>so if you started to get discouraged<br></p><p><b>00:17:38.966 - 00:17:39.700</b><br>and thought<br></p><p><b>00:17:39.700 - 00:17:42.266</b><br>oh man I've got a little too many layers going up here<br></p><p><b>00:17:42.400 - 00:17:45.066</b><br>again you get a spike and clear all your layers again<br></p><p><b>00:17:46.300 - 00:17:47.533</b><br>let me zoom out a little<br></p><p><b>00:17:47.966 - 00:17:51.800</b><br>so anyway continues continues still lots of spikes<br></p><p><b>00:17:52.000 - 00:17:54.900</b><br>the percentage are getting lower 14 to 15<br></p><p><b>00:17:55.700 - 00:17:58.133</b><br>and then we get a beautiful drop<br></p><p><b>00:17:58.133 - 00:17:58.933</b><br>and you know me<br></p><p><b>00:17:58.933 - 00:18:01.866</b><br>I'll have all these layers down here and you get from<br></p><p><b>00:18:01.866 - 00:18:02.666</b><br>11 to 14<br></p><p><b>00:18:03.466 - 00:18:04.600</b><br>beautiful beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:18:04.666 -
