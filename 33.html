00:00:53.166</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.166 - 00:00:55.866</b><br>maybe has to do with bitcoin futures and that you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.866 - 00:00:58.333</b><br>Wall Street starting to come in<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.333 -

00:01:06.566</b><br>I'm by<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.566 - 00:01:08.100</b><br>no means making a prediction<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.300 - 00:01:10.866</b><br>this thing has to crash that back down to 8000<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.100 - 00:01:14.333</b><br>like 8000 is the most obvious place we look at<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.333 - 00:01:17.166</b><br>see over here in this section right here where<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.200 - 00:01:18.500</b><br>you know it just kind of<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.500 - 00:01:20.600</b><br>fought to break 8 fought to break 8<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.600 - 00:01:21.933</b><br>fought to break 8 for<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.133 - 00:01:25.600</b><br>a while like for a few days of trying and then finally<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.600 - 00:01:26.700</b><br>broken when it did<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.800 - 00:01:30.300</b><br>goes up it doesn't even stop at 10 000 it didn't even<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.666 - 00:01:32.566</b><br>there's not even a you know like<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.566 - 00:01:34.866</b><br>oh let's see if we can try to break no<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.866 - 00:01:36.800</b><br>it goes straight through 10 000<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.100 - 00:01:38.933</b><br>like that is a psychological level<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.566 - 00:01:42.300</b><br>and it just ran straight through it no problem<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.533 - 00:01:44.000</b><br>goes all the way up to 11<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.066 - 00:01:46.533</b><br>whatever almost 1150<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.966 - 00:01:48.900</b><br>drops all the way back down through 10<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.900 - 00:01:50.400</b><br>000 like it doesn't exist<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.600 - 00:01:50.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.900 - 00:01:53.533</b><br>like you would usually just bounce off 10 000 no<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.900 - 00:01:54.966</b><br>goes straight through 10<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.966 - 00:01:57.533</b><br>000 like it doesn't exist back down to 9 000<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.066 - 00:01:59.666</b><br>bounces right back through 10<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.666 - 00:02:02.066</b><br>000 again like it doesn't exist back to 10<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.166 - 00:02:02.866</b><br></p><p><b>00:02:02.866 - 00:02:06.866</b><br>back down to 9 000 whatever and then off to the run<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.533 - 00:02:09.133</b><br>again takes off to the run<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.300 - 00:02:10.100</b><br>leaving<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.100 - 00:02:13.600</b><br>a nice little gap from 9000 to 8000 right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.600 - 00:02:15.366</b><br>let's get rid of these little circles here<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.066 - 00:02:17.766</b><br>leaves you a nice little gap right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.866 - 00:02:21.566</b><br>which is not you know a huge gap but that's $1,000<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.900 - 00:02:22.700</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.000 - 00:02:25.900</b><br>as it passes over here okay we could say that<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.966 - 00:02:28.200</b><br>that 12 thousand you know maybe 11<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.566 - 00:02:30.400</b><br>thousand five hundred or something<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.666 - 00:02:33.100</b><br>was a little bit of a temporary top<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.666 - 00:02:36.333</b><br>but when it cracked it did it return<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.600 - 00:02:38.400</b><br>no ho<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.600 - 00:02:41.166</b><br>it drove itself all the way up to almost 17<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.166 - 00:02:44.000</b><br>000 and on some exchanges all the way to 20 000<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.566 - 00:02:48.600</b><br>it took this massive just spike like nobody's business<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.600 - 00:02:50.733</b><br>and then came right back down to about 13<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.466 - 00:02:55.066</b><br>and left us with another gap on this chart<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.966 - 00:02:57.800</b><br>you know like it's just being<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.800 - 00:02:59.666</b><br>this is just showing extreme<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.666 - 00:03:00.733</b><br>extreme buying<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.900 - 00:03:01.733</b><br>like just<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.900 - 00:03:02.900</b><br>like you'd never see<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.933 - 00:03:04.400</b><br>like you just can't imagine<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.500 - 00:03:07.000</b><br>a chart of this size like<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.933 - 00:03:11.400</b><br>a coin of this size having that much money coming in<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.266 - 00:03:13.366</b><br>so where is it going to go<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.800 - 00:03:15.300</b><br>I have no idea<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.500 - 00:03:17.466</b><br>like if you look at what I've done<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.200 - 00:03:19.333</b><br>and you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.500 - 00:03:21.933</b><br>I'm totally happy with my trading<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.933 - 00:03:24.200</b><br>I'm not taking it back I would love<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.466 - 00:03:26.400</b><br>if I hadn't sold so much around<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.533 - 00:03:29.733</b><br>7000 you know because now we're at almost 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.366 - 00:03:32.600</b><br>it would be wonderful if I could predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.600 - 00:03:33.800</b><br>and I just not sell<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.266 - 00:03:35.300</b><br>where is my chart<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.066 - 00:03:37.200</b><br>right here so<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.300 - 00:03:39.266</b><br>look at me over here<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.266 - 00:03:44.333</b><br>I'm selling at 6,000 and 7,000 7,500<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.333 - 00:03:46.333</b><br>and then I picked up a little bit over here<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.766 - 00:03:47.133</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.133 - 00:03:49.566</b><br>then I'm selling and selling and selling and selling<br></p><p><b>00:03:49.566 - 00:03:50.900</b><br>and selling and selling and selling<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.900 - 00:03:51.800</b><br>and this whole<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.933 - 00:03:53.266</b><br>dump right here from<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.266 - 00:03:53.666</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.666 - 00:03:56.000</b><br>that big long day where it went all the way up to 20<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.000 - 00:03:57.366</b><br>and on some exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.466 - 00:04:00.566</b><br>but on ours it went up to like about 17 on betrax<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.700 - 00:04:02.966</b><br>and then dropped all the way down to 1250<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.700 - 00:04:05.800</b><br>was I had my finger on the button<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.866 - 00:04:06.700</b><br>I was like<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.866 - 00:04:07.666</b><br>oh<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.666 - 00:04:11.166</b><br>you know I really I'm expecting that drop down to 8000<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.166 - 00:04:13.000</b><br>so I'm really just watching<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.600 - 00:04:15.066</b><br>you know and if you dial in<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.266 - 00:04:17.300</b><br>you know you could have easily called<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.900 - 00:04:19.700</b><br>oh sorry I don't have a drawer<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.533 - 00:04:23.733</b><br>you could have easily called this a base easily because<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.800 - 00:04:27.700</b><br>a balance from like 1350 all the way up to 1600<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.800 - 00:04:29.600</b><br>that is a definite strong bounce<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.600 - 00:04:30.400</b><br>so that would<br></p><p><b>00:04:30.400 - 00:04:31.100</b><br>easily a base<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.100 - 00:04:31.500</b><br>you could have<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.500 - 00:04:33.900</b><br>easily said this is the start of your safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.933 - 00:04:36.366</b><br>but I was expecting a safe circle like this<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.100 - 00:04:38.600</b><br>not a safe circle like that<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.600 - 00:04:40.966</b><br>so I didn't even I didn't even get in<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.733 - 00:04:45.500</b><br>you know if my base was like at 1350<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.900 - 00:04:47.666</b><br>you know I wasn't getting in at 1250<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.100 - 00:04:51.100</b><br>so I wasn't even nippling at that point<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.200 - 00:04:53.000</b><br>so yeah<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.000 - 00:04:54.366</b><br>anyway here let me draw that back<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.266 - 00:04:58.666</b><br>so yeah I really expected a big<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.666 - 00:05:00.466</b><br>huge safe circle and we didn't get any<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.266 - 00:05:03.200</b><br>that's because the buying is so insane<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.200 - 00:05:04.266</b><br>and then of course<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.266 - 00:05:06.066</b><br>you could draw a base right here at 15<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.366 - 00:05:08.100</b><br>whatever 1500 let's say<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.000 - 00:05:13.000</b><br>because look at this bounce like it went from 17 to 15<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.000 - 00:05:15.100</b><br>and then all the way to 19<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.700 - 00:05:17.466</b><br>so there's bases all over this place<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.866 - 00:05:21.066</b><br>there's places to draw your safe circles with no issues<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.266 - 00:05:23.866</b><br>there's tons of spots to draw your safe circles<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.866 - 00:05:25.733</b><br>and then there's gaps all over the place<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.966 - 00:05:27.800</b><br>but anyway getting back to what I was saying<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.200 - 00:05:30.166</b><br>obviously I just just sold a little bit again<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.533 - 00:05:33.100</b><br>this is just a<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.100 - 00:05:35.900</b><br>I guess I can't scroll back further<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.866 - 00:05:38.466</b><br>this is just constant<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.466 - 00:05:40.400</b><br>selling and selling and selling and selling and<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.400 - 00:05:42.666</b><br>never getting an opportunity to buy more<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.733 - 00:05:45.466</b><br>you know that's unfortunate<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.466 - 00:05:46.900</b><br>we can look at a few other things<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.166 - 00:05:49.166</b><br>obviously I've been trading other things like Neo<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.466 - 00:05:51.900</b><br>and an Ethereum you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.566 -

00:08:01.400</b><br>man so I'm just selling<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.400 - 00:08:02.933</b><br>every once in a while when I get that feeling<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.933 - 00:08:05.100</b><br>I'm selling 30 percent of what I have left<br></p><p><b>00:08:05.933 -

00:08:16.533</b><br>and we're back golden but regardless I cannot complain<br></p><p><b>00:08:16.533 - 00:08:18.900</b><br>because we made so much on that run<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.066 - 00:08:22.500</b><br>that just insanity that you know all those free coins<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.733 -

00:08:35.733</b><br>even though<br></p><p><b>00:08:35.733 - 00:08:37.200</b><br>there might have been a little base right there<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.200 - 00:08:38.933</b><br>and I bought in that little circle<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.966 - 00:08:40.666</b><br>and there's obviously a base right there<br></p><p><b>00:08:40.666 - 00:08:41.933</b><br>and I bought over there<br></p><p><b>00:08:42.066 - 00:08:44.300</b><br>and obviously there's a base here and I bought there<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.900 - 00:08:46.266</b><br>then I took a little bit of profit<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.266 - 00:08:47.666</b><br>and I took a little bit of profit<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.666 - 00:08:49.733</b><br>but then of course I was ready to buy again<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.733 - 00:08:51.000</b><br>so I got it over there<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.133 - 00:08:52.166</b><br>and then I watched it go up<br></p><p><b>00:08:52.166 - 00:08:53.700</b><br>and I never actually took profit<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.800 - 00:08:54.766</b><br>and then I saw<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.900 - 00:08:56.266</b><br>if you scroll in a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:08:56.266 - 00:08:57.600</b><br>you can see all this beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.600 - 00:09:00.000</b><br>jumping back and forth from 45 to 50<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.000 - 00:09:01.066</b><br>and 45 to 50<br></p><p><b>00:09:01.100 - 00:09:03.566</b><br>so I got it in on one of these little spikes<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.933 - 00:09:04.866</b><br>so I'm still in<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.400 - 00:09:07.700</b><br>but it's because I want to own neo2<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.700 - 00:09:08.700</b><br>so you know<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.700 - 00:09:10.333</b><br>while I'm taking a little bit of profit<br></p><p><b>00:09:10.333 - 00:09:11.800</b><br>because it's just too easy<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.800 - 00:09:13.733</b><br>when I see something like that's just too easy<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.266 - 00:09:14.500</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.500 - 00:09:16.700</b><br>I'm able to take some profit and get right back in<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.933 - 00:09:19.700</b><br>and still hold it for the future so<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.466 -

00:13:43.566</b><br>bottom 450 Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:13:44.300 - 00:13:45.500</b><br>and then later on<br></p><p><b>00:13:45.600 - 00:13:46.133</b><br>another guy<br></p><p><b>00:13:46.133 - 00:13:49.666</b><br>that guy sold him to somebody else for 49 Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:13:50.000 - 00:13:52.566</b><br>so there's like I mean that's a huge loss right<br></p><p><b>00:13:52.566 - 00:13:54.900</b><br>that's 100 ethereum loss<br></p><p><b>00:13:55.133 - 00:13:58.333</b><br>so what is that 70 thousand dollar loss or something<br></p><p><b>00:13:59.300 - 00:14:00.100</b><br>you know so<br></p><p><b>00:14:00.200 - 00:14:01.133</b><br>I mean these kitties<br></p><p><b>00:14:01.133 - 00:14:03.333</b><br>let's see what happened with Kitty number five<br></p><p><b>00:14:04.100 - 00:14:05.533</b><br>Kitty No. 5<br></p><p><b>00:14:06.600 - 00:14:09.600</b><br>so you get to see their sales let 202<br></p><p><b>00:14:09.733 - 00:14:12.600</b><br>Ethereum you know so there's probably<br></p><p><b>00:14:12.733 - 00:14:14.966</b><br>one of the biggest transactions<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.000 - 00:14:16.100</b><br>and then somebody<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.133 - 00:14:18.400</b><br>49 Ethereum and so forth anyway<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.400 - 00:14:21.133</b><br>so you can just do this with all of these kitties<br></p><p><b>00:14:21.500 - 00:14:22.466</b><br>let me move this over<br></p><p><b>00:14:23.800 - 00:14:25.900</b><br>so you know you can go down the list<br></p><p><b>00:14:25.966 - 00:14:26.666</b><br>but you'll see that<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.666 - 00:14:28.500</b><br>this is what people are asking for them<br></p><p><b>00:14:28.733 - 00:14:31.066</b><br>but that's because they are gen 0<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.666 - 00:14:34.866</b><br>and Gen 0 is the very first<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.500 - 00:14:37.533</b><br>generation of cryptokities<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.733 - 00:14:38.666</b><br>then when they<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.666 - 00:14:41.966</b><br>mate with another gen 0 or Gen 1 or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:14:42.333 - 00:14:43.400</b><br>they produce babies<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.400 - 00:14:45.700</b><br>and you're not gonna find babies on any of these guys<br></p><p><b>00:14:45.700 - 00:14:47.300</b><br>probably because these guys will be<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.133 - 00:14:48.933</b><br>having<br></p><p><b>00:14:49.066 - 00:14:50.933</b><br>trying to keep them completely rare<br></p><p><b>00:14:51.600 - 00:14:53.533</b><br>these guys will have had no children<br></p><p><b>00:14:54.500 - 00:14:55.533</b><br>but they can't<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.533 - 00:14:56.166</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.166 - 00:14:56.966</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:14:58.300 - 00:15:01.300</b><br>and so the way it works is when you produce children<br></p><p><b>00:15:01.300 - 00:15:02.466</b><br>when you mate with another<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.466 - 00:15:03.966</b><br>cryptocating you produce kids<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.766 - 00:15:06.900</b><br>then there's these cooldowns<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.966 - 00:15:09.600</b><br>and you'll see that it goes fast with<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.666 - 00:15:12.900</b><br>snappy brisk plotting slow sluggish catatonic<br></p><p><b>00:15:13.133 - 00:15:14.366</b><br>and it shows you how long<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.366 - 00:15:16.066</b><br>it takes you to produce a child<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.133 - 00:15:18.100</b><br>so you can produce another kitty<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.733 - 00:15:20.766</b><br>in one minute right now with this guy<br></p><p><b>00:15:20.766 - 00:15:22.166</b><br>because he's on fast<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.333 - 00:15:24.700</b><br>and after you produce a few children<br></p><p><b>00:15:25.400 - 00:15:26.766</b><br>then you turn to Swift<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.900 - 00:15:27.966</b><br>and then it takes you<br></p><p><b>00:15:27.966 - 00:15:30.266</b><br>two minutes to five minutes to produce a child<br></p><p><b>00:15:30.533 - 00:15:32.566</b><br>and then after you produce a few children you turn to<br></p><p><b>00:15:32.566 - 00:15:34.300</b><br>snappy and then I think<br></p><p><b>00:15:34.300 - 00:15:36.266</b><br>every time you produce a child after that<br></p><p><b>00:15:36.266 - 00:15:39.000</b><br>snappy takes you 10 to 30 minutes<br></p><p><b>00:15:39.100 - 00:15:40.666</b><br>brisk takes you an hour to 2<br></p><p><b>00:15:41.166 - 00:15:43.700</b><br>plotting takes you 48 and so on you can see the list<br></p><p><b>00:15:44.300 - 00:15:45.100</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.133 - 00:15:46.200</b><br>that's how it works right<br></p><p><b>00:15:46.200 - 00:15:46.966</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:15:46.966 - 00:15:50.933</b><br>to keep its rarity because this is a game of rarity<br></p><p><b>00:15:51.466 - 00:15:52.266</b><br>to<br></p><p><b>00:15:52.533 - 00:15:54.966</b><br>hold its value to keep its rarity<br></p><p><b>00:15:55.333 - 00:15:58.566</b><br>these big guys who have spent all this money know<br></p><p><b>00:15:59.066 - 00:16:00.000</b><br>that the reason<br></p><p><b>00:16:00.000 - 00:16:00.566</b><br>they spent that<br></p><p><b>00:16:00.566 - 00:16:02.933</b><br>much money is because they're getting the 10th kitty<br></p><p><b>00:16:02.933 - 00:16:04.166</b><br>ever in existence<br></p><p><b>00:16:04.766 -

00:18:55.200</b><br>realized after taking a look at this website<br></p><p><b>00:18:55.200 - 00:18:56.733</b><br>I thought it was all foolishness<br></p><p><b>00:18:57.000 - 00:18:59.333</b><br>but when I saw the numbers of what people<br></p><p><b>00:18:59.333 -

00:19:12.100</b><br>what I realized is why are these kitty No. 2<br></p><p><b>00:19:12.100 - 00:19:14.333</b><br>kitty No. 5 and kitty No. 6 and all these<br></p><p><b>00:19:14.533 - 00:19:16.000</b><br>small number kitties<br></p><p><b>00:19:16.100 -

00:19:33.333</b><br>so all of a sudden something will come out<br></p><p><b>00:19:33.466 - 00:19:35.300</b><br>that will be a trait that nobody has<br></p><p><b>00:19:35.666 - 00:19:37.100</b><br>and then you know because<br></p><p><b>00:19:37.466 - 00:19:39.400</b><br>just randomly through production<br></p><p><b>00:19:39.533 - 00:19:43.100</b><br>through the genetics of the algorithm of the game<br></p><p><b>00:19:43.533 - 00:19:45.566</b><br>every so often this rare trait will come out<br></p><p><b>00:19:46.200 -

00:27:27.000</b><br>so you know in the past like over here<br></p><p><b>00:27:27.600 - 00:27:30.333</b><br>when it was running up it was dropping<br></p><p><b>00:27:30.533 - 00:27:31.800</b><br>so what's different now<br></p><p><b>00:27:31.966 - 00:27:34.000</b><br>what would what would cause<br></p><p><b>00:27:34.000 - 00:27:35.066</b><br>Bitcoin to run<br></p><p><b>00:27:35.900 - 00:27:37.966</b><br>an Ethereum not to fall<br></p><p><b>00:27:38.333 -

00:27:45.100</b><br>if Ethereum falls and Neo falls and<br></p><p><b>00:27:45.133 - 00:27:47.533</b><br>all of these alt coins start falling but<br></p><p><b>00:27:47.533 - 00:27:49.000</b><br>Bitcoin starts running<br></p><p><b>00:27:49.100 - 00:27:50.566</b><br>then what you're thinking<br></p><p><b>00:27:50.666 - 00:27:53.133</b><br>is that people are selling the alts<br></p><p><b>00:27:53.166 - 00:27:54.300</b><br>to buy Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:27:54.533 - 00:27:55.333</b><br>right so it's just like a<br></p><p><b>00:27:55.333 - 00:27:57.000</b><br>transfer of money because they think<br></p><p><b>00:27:57.200 - 00:27:59.100</b><br>something big is about to happen with Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:27:59.100 - 00:28:00.200</b><br>and then all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:28:00.300 - 00:28:02.966</b><br>when Bitcoin starts dropping and the alt start rising<br></p><p><b>00:28:02.966 - 00:28:03.933</b><br>you're thinking the same thing<br></p><p><b>00:28:03.933 - 00:28:04.966</b><br>you're thinking oh<br></p><p><b>00:28:05.266 - 00:28:08.933</b><br>okay so they're selling their Bitcoin and buying<br></p><p><b>00:28:09.166 - 00:28:11.533</b><br>alt coin so it's just money moving back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:28:11.533 - 00:28:12.900</b><br>but in this case<br></p><p><b>00:28:13.300 - 00:28:16.900</b><br>bitcoin is going up but the alts aren't falling<br></p><p><b>00:28:17.100 - 00:28:18.966</b><br>so this is new money<br></p><p><b>00:28:19.333 - 00:28:21.666</b><br>that's new money coming in right<br></p><p><b>00:28:21.900 - 00:28:22.966</b><br>which means<br></p><p><b>00:28:22.966 - 00:28:25.500</b><br>that if bitcoin kind of holds itself up here<br></p><p><b>00:28:25.566 - 00:28:27.800</b><br>the alts are going to start to follow up too<br></p><p><b>00:28:27.800 - 00:28:29.733</b><br>they're just going to fall a little further behind<br></p><p><b>00:28:30.366 - 00:28:32.100</b><br>anyway that has nothing to do with my trading<br></p><p><b>00:28:32.133 -
