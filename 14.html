00:03:44.066</b><br>the scanner will allow me to trade day trade in<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.066 - 00:03:44.966</b><br>the market here<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.966 - 00:03:47.300</b><br>in coins and get out of the stock market in day<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.300 - 00:03:47.866</b><br>trade in coins<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.866 - 00:03:51.300</b><br>but it's a game changer for me because<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.966 - 00:03:53.900</b><br>I need that I need to trade all day<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.900 -

00:04:01.166</b><br>what I do every day<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.166 - 00:04:04.200</b><br>it's like my bread and butter of it's like my work<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.200 - 00:04:07.733</b><br>right so but position sizing is where you grow your<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.733 - 00:04:09.066</b><br>wealth and where you really<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.066 - 00:04:10.533</b><br>really make money right<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.533 - 00:04:12.100</b><br>and that's what I'm teaching you in my<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.100 - 00:04:13.600</b><br>videos is position<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.866 - 00:04:16.866</b><br>position trading versus<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.100 - 00:04:19.466</b><br>day trading which is where you make 500<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.000 - 00:04:22.466</b><br>$1,000 a day you know like you just<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.500 - 00:04:23.666</b><br>you're making your money<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.666 - 00:04:27.066</b><br>you're just making your daily income but<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.066 -
