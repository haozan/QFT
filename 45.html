00:00:04.966</b><br>so if you haven't watched part 2<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.100 - 00:00:05.733</b><br>of<br></p><p><b>00:00:05.733 - 00:00:08.000</b><br>this video series then please go back and watch part 2<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.000 - 00:00:08.333</b><br>otherwise<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.333 - 00:00:10.200</b><br>part 3 is not going to make very much sense to you<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.000 - 00:00:15.133</b><br>so in Part 2 of the series we discussed<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.733 - 00:00:17.166</b><br>that the real problem<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.166 - 00:00:19.566</b><br>facing traders is that they can't predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.133 - 00:00:21.600</b><br>and so you just don't know<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.600 - 00:00:23.066</b><br>if the market's going to go up and down<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.333 - 00:00:24.200</b><br>so we discuss that<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.200 - 00:00:26.466</b><br>there's a bunch of different solutions or<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.466 - 00:00:28.400</b><br>ideas that people have used<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.600 - 00:00:30.500</b><br>to try to attack that problem<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.600 - 00:00:32.000</b><br>but the most elegant one<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.166 - 00:00:34.900</b><br>in my opinion is the mathematical system<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.066 - 00:00:37.900</b><br>coming up with some sort of mathematical system<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.100 - 00:00:40.966</b><br>that allows you to profit regardless of market<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.966 - 00:00:43.500</b><br>direction whether it goes up or whether it goes down<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.500 - 00:00:44.700</b><br>it doesn't really matter<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.800 - 00:00:47.666</b><br>because you have some kind of a mathematical system<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.733 - 00:00:50.800</b><br>that allows the odds to always end up in your favor<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.900 - 00:00:52.133</b><br>and always<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.200 - 00:00:55.933</b><br>give you a positive outcome after a series of trades<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.466 - 00:00:59.533</b><br>so the most common adage or theme<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.700 - 00:01:01.066</b><br>that traders use<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.300 - 00:01:03.466</b><br>who are trying to figure out the math and put<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.466 - 00:01:04.533</b><br>odds in their favor<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.766 - 00:01:08.366</b><br>cut your losers quick and let your winners run<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.766 - 00:01:09.666</b><br>did I put a<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.666 - 00:01:11.133</b><br>capital I on winners<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.733 - 00:01:12.933</b><br>there we go so<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.066 - 00:01:14.800</b><br>basically<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.800 - 00:01:17.000</b><br>especially in the 4x market<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.000 - 00:01:21.500</b><br>traders who are trying to use this type of math to<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.933 - 00:01:23.333</b><br>get good odds<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.766 - 00:01:25.800</b><br>what they're trying to do is they're trying to only<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.800 - 00:01:26.666</b><br>predict<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.200 - 00:01:30.133</b><br>short term moves in the market and not long term<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.300 - 00:01:32.566</b><br>they want to profit from long term<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.566 - 00:01:34.733</b><br>but they just want to be able to find good<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.733 - 00:01:37.100</b><br>entries where they can get in and be positive right<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.100 - 00:01:37.900</b><br>away<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.266 - 00:01:39.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.500 - 00:01:42.066</b><br>to do this they'll use a stop loss<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.733 - 00:01:45.100</b><br>so let's go back to the chart for a second and let's<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.366 - 00:01:48.266</b><br>scroll in let's really move on into this chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.266 - 00:01:50.166</b><br>and we'll switch it to a<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.666 - 00:01:53.666</b><br>I don't know like a five minute chart all right<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.166 - 00:01:57.366</b><br>so we can really see what's happening today<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.533 - 00:02:00.800</b><br>usually the theory<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.066 - 00:02:03.900</b><br>is to work with a risk reward ratio<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.933 - 00:02:06.566</b><br>and it's usually 3 to 1 or greater<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.166 - 00:02:09.000</b><br>so what that means is that<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.333 - 00:02:11.700</b><br>if they were going to take a position<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.700 - 00:02:14.400</b><br>like let's say they were going to go short right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.366 - 00:02:18.200</b><br>then they would put a stop 3<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.200 - 00:02:19.133</b><br>1 what<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.700 - 00:02:24.066</b><br>one third of where they are planning to exit the trade<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.866 - 00:02:26.733</b><br>so it would be like a stop here<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.333 - 00:02:29.966</b><br>and take profit here<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.333 - 00:02:31.866</b><br>so that would make it a 3 to 1<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.866 - 00:02:35.133</b><br>that means that they can lose three times<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.133 - 00:02:37.400</b><br>they can hit their stop three times<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.566 - 00:02:39.733</b><br>for the amount of profit<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.866 - 00:02:41.166</b><br>let me try to explain that better<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.766 - 00:02:44.266</b><br>so what that means is despite whatever their<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.600 - 00:02:46.066</b><br>system for entry is<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.366 - 00:02:48.933</b><br>they're looking at some kind of chart pattern<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.166 - 00:02:50.466</b><br>and when they take an entry<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.466 - 00:02:52.366</b><br>let's say they were going to take an entry right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.733 - 00:02:55.366</b><br>then wherever their plan is to take profit<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.366 - 00:02:57.733</b><br>so let's say they were planning to take profit here<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.466 - 00:03:02.266</b><br>then they put a stop only 1/3 of that length<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.266 - 00:03:04.366</b><br>so maybe they put their stop here<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.800 - 00:03:05.800</b><br>you know so that<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.900 - 00:03:08.733</b><br>so that they can be wrong three times one<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.900 - 00:03:12.200</b><br>one right equals three times wrong<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.366 - 00:03:14.500</b><br>so they can be wrong three times and when<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.500 - 00:03:17.100</b><br>only wants to cover all of their losses<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.400 - 00:03:19.366</b><br>and then as they get better<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.400 - 00:03:21.900</b><br>at trading and they can find their entries better<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.366 - 00:03:24.466</b><br>then what happens is<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.466 - 00:03:26.600</b><br>maybe they win<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.700 - 00:03:27.500</b><br>win<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.766 - 00:03:33.300</b><br>lose lose win win lose lose but net<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.933 - 00:03:35.733</b><br>they win because<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.966 - 00:03:36.766</b><br>even if they<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.766 - 00:03:41.133</b><br>lose twice and win twice and lose twice and win twice<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.166 - 00:03:43.533</b><br>it ends up that they make a lot of money<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.666 - 00:03:47.366</b><br>because they can lose 3 times<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.466 - 00:03:50.333</b><br>and only win once and still break even<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.533 - 00:03:55.066</b><br>this kind of risk reward mathematics that<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.200 - 00:03:57.733</b><br>most traders are using in the forex market<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.133 - 00:03:59.666</b><br>is also what this<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.666 - 00:04:02.466</b><br>traitor that we're going to look at what he's using<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.566 - 00:04:05.566</b><br>the difference is his risk reward ratio<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.666 - 00:04:06.966</b><br>is something like<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.533 - 00:04:08.500</b><br>I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.733 - 00:04:11.066</b><br>maybe sorry<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.933 - 00:04:15.933</b><br>maybe 10,000<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.700 - 00:04:27.466</b><br>maybe 10,000 to 1 or maybe 100,000<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.300 - 00:04:30.933</b><br>maybe 100,000 to 1<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.100 - 00:04:34.200</b><br>his Grace reward ratio is insanity<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.766 - 00:04:38.066</b><br>that means some of these trades they takes won't be<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.066 - 00:04:39.600</b><br>closed for months<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.733 - 00:04:42.766</b><br>or even years it could be years<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.000 - 00:04:45.933</b><br>so while his risk is you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.933 - 00:04:49.266</b><br>10 pips or 20 pips or something his risk is very small<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.266 - 00:04:50.600</b><br>maybe 20 dollars on<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.600 - 00:04:52.133</b><br>if it's $1 a pip<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.100 - 00:04:54.700</b><br>he won't close that<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.866 - 00:04:56.333</b><br>possibly until<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.900 - 00:05:00.966</b><br>3000 pips later you know or 5000 pips later<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.066 - 00:05:05.700</b><br>now we're not going to talk about his entry criteria<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.266 - 00:05:10.466</b><br>too much because even him if you read his forum<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.566 - 00:05:12.733</b><br>you'll see that he says the entry criteria is not the<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.733 - 00:05:13.566</b><br>important thing<br></p><p><b>00:05:13.733 - 00:05:15.100</b><br>basically you can use<br></p><p><b>00:05:15.400 - 00:05:18.600</b><br>whatever entry criteria you develop that you want<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.733 - 00:05:20.700</b><br>however you decide to make your entries<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.700 - 00:05:22.000</b><br>that's not what's important<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.100 - 00:05:23.100</b><br>I know for him<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.766 - 00:05:26.300</b><br>he does it on what's called a flying Buddha<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.400 - 00:05:29.466</b><br>so basically I think what he's doing is he's putting<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.333 - 00:05:33.066</b><br>Emas on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:05:33.200 - 00:05:35.333</b><br>so moving averages he puts<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.333 - 00:05:37.200</b><br>exponential moving averages on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.200 - 00:05:40.066</b><br>he uses like a 5 period and a 10 period<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.266 - 00:05:42.766</b><br>and Flying Buddha is basically when<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.300 - 00:05:45.366</b><br>there's a candle above<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.766 - 00:05:47.566</b><br>a 5 period moving average<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.566 - 00:05:49.733</b><br>when the 5 is above the tan or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.733 - 00:05:50.466</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.466 - 00:05:51.166</b><br>when<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.166 - 00:05:55.500</b><br>it looks like the trend is going higher and the two<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.500 - 00:05:58.266</b><br>moving averages are on top of each other<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.266 - 00:06:00.266</b><br>and then you get a candle outside them<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.333 - 00:06:01.900</b><br>that would initiate a tree<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.366 - 00:06:05.166</b><br>okay so I've taken us back to a one day chart now<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.800 - 00:06:08.066</b><br>so each candle here is a dig<br></p><p><b>00:06:09.200 - 00:06:10.000</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:06:11.700 -

00:07:53.500</b><br>you are not trying to pick market direction<br></p><p><b>00:07:54.066 - 00:07:57.333</b><br>all you are trying to do is on a daily basis<br></p><p><b>00:07:57.466 - 00:07:59.900</b><br>take two or three traits<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.066 -

00:08:15.366</b><br>so he'll be looking at may over here<br></p><p><b>00:08:15.466 - 00:08:18.733</b><br>and saying it was a downtran all of may<br></p><p><b>00:08:18.800 - 00:08:19.866</b><br>and then July<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.566 - 00:08:22.533</b><br>middle of may to middle of July<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.700 - 00:08:25.666</b><br>it started to go sideways but again it broke lower<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.700 - 00:08:28.266</b><br>so the general trend is down<br></p><p><b>00:08:28.400 - 00:08:32.133</b><br>so he's gonna favor short positions over long positions<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.200 - 00:08:33.533</b><br>but that doesn't mean he's not gonna<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.533 - 00:08:34.733</b><br>take long positions<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.733 -

00:08:42.733</b><br>let's just go for the middle of the chart here<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.400 - 00:08:44.400</b><br>let's zoom in<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.000 - 00:08:49.966</b><br>let me get to a place where I can move okay zoom in<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.066 -

00:09:05.000</b><br>so we're not going to try<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.000 - 00:09:07.366</b><br>to figure out how he does his entries<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.366 - 00:09:09.733</b><br>and he even said himself that that's not<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.733 - 00:09:10.866</b><br>really what's important<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.133 - 00:09:12.733</b><br>so we're gonna not put some<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.900 - 00:09:14.466</b><br>moving averages on here<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.566 -

00:09:27.333</b><br>traders would do<br></p><p><b>00:09:27.566 - 00:09:29.933</b><br>so basically what he's looking for<br></p><p><b>00:09:29.933 - 00:09:32.500</b><br>is he's looking to see what's the weekly trend<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.500 - 00:09:34.533</b><br>and of course right here you see the weekly trend<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.533 - 00:09:36.700</b><br>would be up and now<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.700 - 00:09:38.733</b><br>the trend kind of changed and now the<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.733 - 00:09:40.700</b><br>weekly trend is going down<br></p><p><b>00:09:40.866 - 00:09:45.400</b><br>so we can draw some lines and say that was clearly<br></p><p><b>00:09:46.166 - 00:09:47.566</b><br>a trend going up<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.766 - 00:09:51.300</b><br>and then we can draw some lines here and say this is<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.300 - 00:09:53.133</b><br>clearly a trend going down<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.266 - 00:09:53.900</b><br>my lines a little<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.900 -

00:10:06.733</b><br>now that we have two points on our trend<br></p><p><b>00:10:06.900 - 00:10:08.600</b><br>we would maybe take a short<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.766 - 00:10:12.000</b><br>right near our trend line right there and if we<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.700 - 00:10:15.933</b><br>were taking longs we might have taken along here<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.266 - 00:10:18.066</b><br>and we might have taken along here<br></p><p><b>00:10:18.133 - 00:10:19.866</b><br>and we might have taken along here<br></p><p><b>00:10:20.466 - 00:10:22.333</b><br>and every time you take a short<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.500 - 00:10:24.000</b><br>or every time you take along<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.100 - 00:10:26.700</b><br>you would have to have a stop based on his system<br></p><p><b>00:10:26.866 - 00:10:27.733</b><br>so you put<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.866 - 00:10:30.166</b><br>a stop of whatever it is<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.666 - 00:10:32.133</b><br>let me<br></p><p><b>00:10:32.133 - 00:10:34.266</b><br>put a stop over here stop right there<br></p><p><b>00:10:34.800 - 00:10:35.966</b><br>and then let's say<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.000 - 00:10:38.600</b><br>you took that long right here a stop right there<br></p><p><b>00:10:40.800 - 00:10:42.000</b><br>you have to put a stop<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.200 -

00:10:52.333</b><br>once you get into a positive spot like let's say<br></p><p><b>00:10:52.333 - 00:10:52.933</b><br>on this one<br></p><p><b>00:10:52.933 - 00:10:55.133</b><br>if you manage to get in somewhere here and it didn't<br></p><p><b>00:10:55.133 - 00:10:55.966</b><br>hit your stop<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.466 - 00:10:58.166</b><br>as soon as you're in a positive spot<br></p><p><b>00:10:58.166 - 00:11:00.300</b><br>you move your stop up to brake even<br></p><p><b>00:11:01.400 - 00:11:02.466</b><br>and same thing here<br></p><p><b>00:11:02.466 - 00:11:03.800</b><br>let's say you took that trade right there<br></p><p><b>00:11:03.800 - 00:11:05.266</b><br>and it actually never went anywhere<br></p><p><b>00:11:05.533 - 00:11:06.600</b><br>it just started going up<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.600 - 00:11:08.666</b><br>then you move your stop to break even<br></p><p><b>00:11:08.733 - 00:11:09.966</b><br>and you try to do this<br></p><p><b>00:11:09.966 - 00:11:11.900</b><br>like right now we're looking at a three hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.900 - 00:11:15.200</b><br>so he'd be zoomed right right right in<br></p><p><b>00:11:15.300 - 00:11:16.533</b><br>and be doing this<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.166 - 00:11:18.800</b><br>and trying every day<br></p><p><b>00:11:19.133 - 00:11:19.933</b><br>to take<br></p><p><b>00:11:20.766 - 00:11:23.366</b><br>one or two trades especially if it goes positive<br></p><p><b>00:11:23.466 - 00:11:24.866</b><br>if he starts hitting his stops<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.866 - 00:11:26.466</b><br>well he just hits his stops and that's it<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.466 - 00:11:28.933</b><br>he's out and that was just a day<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.200 - 00:11:32.300</b><br>that cost him a little bit on his portfolio<br></p><p><b>00:11:32.533 - 00:11:35.800</b><br>but if it manages to go into the positive<br></p><p><b>00:11:35.800 - 00:11:38.366</b><br>then he's going to try to what he calls stack<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.500 - 00:11:39.800</b><br>and he's going to try to get<br></p><p><b>00:11:40.533 - 00:11:42.400</b><br>another trade in there if he can<br></p><p><b>00:11:42.933 - 00:11:45.933</b><br>so that he's got a few of what he calls soldiers<br></p><p><b>00:11:47.733 - 00:11:50.133</b><br>basically he's taking these longs<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.000 - 00:11:53.566</b><br>because he sees that the market is going higher<br></p><p><b>00:11:53.733 - 00:11:56.533</b><br>and then as soon as he sees that this trend is broken<br></p><p><b>00:11:56.533 - 00:11:57.900</b><br>see right here it's broken<br></p><p><b>00:11:58.133 - 00:12:00.766</b><br>now he's gonna be looking to try to take shorts<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.800 - 00:12:03.600</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:12:03.733 - 00:12:06.666</b><br>because we're working with FXCM<br></p><p><b>00:12:07.100 - 00:12:08.266</b><br>you already know<br></p><p><b>00:12:08.333 - 00:12:11.100</b><br>that each of these positions are going to be<br></p><p><b>00:12:11.333 -

00:12:25.500</b><br>you may have<br></p><p><b>00:12:25.866 - 00:12:28.266</b><br>three or five or 10<br></p><p><b>00:12:28.666 - 00:12:30.766</b><br>longs on this<br></p><p><b>00:12:31.000 - 00:12:31.800</b><br>move up<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.133 - 00:12:34.333</b><br>each of those things are going to<br></p><p><b>00:12:34.566 - 00:12:35.300</b><br>be their own positions<br></p><p><b>00:12:35.300 - 00:12:36.700</b><br>they don't get added together<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.700 -

00:13:49.000</b><br>so this one kind of just disappears<br></p><p><b>00:13:49.900 - 00:13:51.000</b><br>and that's going to be<br></p><p><b>00:13:51.133 - 00:13:53.866</b><br>part of the expense of running this system<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.166 - 00:13:56.566</b><br>but of course because you bought here and it went up<br></p><p><b>00:13:56.733 - 00:13:58.500</b><br>you moved yourself to break even<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.600 - 00:13:59.533</b><br>this thing came down<br></p><p><b>00:13:59.533 -

00:14:15.100</b><br>and so throughout the day because you're taking<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.400 - 00:14:18.100</b><br>of around three positions a day if possible<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.533 - 00:14:20.400</b><br>you have the potential<br></p><p><b>00:14:20.600 -

00:14:29.500</b><br>so anyway let's zoom out<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.100 - 00:14:32.700</b><br>and I'm just going to put in some random lines<br></p><p><b>00:14:32.700 - 00:14:34.766</b><br>let me switch to be able to move this thing<br></p><p><b>00:14:36.100 - 00:14:36.900</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:14:36.933 - 00:14:38.366</b><br>let's just say that<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.766 - 00:14:39.800</b><br>you're going to get<br></p><p><b>00:14:39.866 - 00:14:41.333</b><br>I gotta switch back<br></p><p><b>00:14:41.700 - 00:14:43.666</b><br>let's just say that you're going to go short<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.666 - 00:14:46.166</b><br>you know up here because it broke that trend line<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.300 - 00:14:48.000</b><br>and then you're going to go short here<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.300 - 00:14:50.900</b><br>and maybe you went short here and went short here<br></p><p><b>00:14:51.000 - 00:14:52.100</b><br>and short here<br></p><p><b>00:14:52.533 - 00:14:54.266</b><br>and you're taking all of these shorts<br></p><p><b>00:14:54.266 - 00:14:56.900</b><br>but at the same time while you're taking these shorts<br></p><p><b>00:14:57.500 - 00:15:00.366</b><br>as the market is coming down to these levels<br></p><p><b>00:15:00.600 - 00:15:02.066</b><br>you're losing this one<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.266 - 00:15:04.000</b><br>and then once it comes down to these levels<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.000 - 00:15:05.300</b><br>you lost this one<br></p><p><b>00:15:05.733 - 00:15:07.266</b><br>and once it comes down to these levels<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.266 - 00:15:08.733</b><br>you lost this one<br></p><p><b>00:15:08.800 - 00:15:09.600</b><br>and you know<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.600 - 00:15:12.733</b><br>that's again the mentality the hard part of this<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.300 - 00:15:17.733</b><br>this one was probably worth over $1,000 at one point<br></p><p><b>00:15:17.733 - 00:15:20.900</b><br>and now it's getting crossed out had brake even<br></p><p><b>00:15:21.133 - 00:15:23.300</b><br>so that's very hard to accept<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.966 - 00:15:26.133</b><br>let me just move this sideways<br></p><p><b>00:15:30.500 - 00:15:31.600</b><br>again so<br></p><p><b>00:15:32.766 - 00:15:34.100</b><br>actually nothing ever hit this one<br></p><p><b>00:15:34.100 - 00:15:35.866</b><br>so this one and this one get to live<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.866 - 00:15:38.466</b><br>and this is what he calls soldiers<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.766 - 00:15:40.133</b><br>well they're all called soldiers<br></p><p><b>00:15:40.133 - 00:15:41.266</b><br>but this soldier died<br></p><p><b>00:15:41.266 - 00:15:43.333</b><br>this soldier died this soldier died<br></p><p><b>00:15:43.566 - 00:15:45.900</b><br>this one got to live and this one got to live<br></p><p><b>00:15:46.500 - 00:15:48.300</b><br>now you got some more shorts that you<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.300 - 00:15:49.666</b><br>maybe took right here<br></p><p><b>00:15:49.666 - 00:15:50.000</b><br>oh<br></p><p><b>00:15:50.000 - 00:15:51.733</b><br>sorry I need<br></p><p><b>00:15:52.733 - 00:15:54.666</b><br>a thing so maybe you took a short here<br></p><p><b>00:15:55.200 - 00:15:57.566</b><br>and if you had taken a short anywhere in this section<br></p><p><b>00:15:57.566 - 00:15:59.000</b><br>it would have already kicked you out<br></p><p><b>00:15:59.000 - 00:16:00.166</b><br>so you took a short there<br></p><p><b>00:16:00.466 - 00:16:03.866</b><br>and then now the market again starts to change<br></p><p><b>00:16:03.866 - 00:16:06.066</b><br>and this trend line that you would have drawn<br></p><p><b>00:16:06.200 - 00:16:08.600</b><br>going this direction got broken<br></p><p><b>00:16:08.933 - 00:16:11.766</b><br>the market is back on an upwards trend<br></p><p><b>00:16:11.800 - 00:16:13.400</b><br>you can again draw your lines<br></p><p><b>00:16:13.400 - 00:16:14.733</b><br>and you can start taking long<br></p><p><b>00:16:14.733 - 00:16:16.733</b><br>so you might take this long here<br></p><p><b>00:16:16.900 - 00:16:18.533</b><br>and you might take a long there<br></p><p><b>00:16:18.700 - 00:16:20.300</b><br>and you might take a long there<br></p><p><b>00:16:20.866 - 00:16:21.666</b><br>but meanwhile<br></p><p><b>00:16:21.666 - 00:16:25.300</b><br>this whole market movement caused this to get killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.400 - 00:16:27.400</b><br>and this soldier to get killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:27.500 - 00:16:29.300</b><br>and this soldier to get killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.500 - 00:16:30.866</b><br>and this soldier to get killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:30.866 - 00:16:32.200</b><br>and this soldier to get killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:32.266 - 00:16:34.133</b><br>and then this soldier to get killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:35.266 - 00:16:36.733</b><br>then the market turns down again<br></p><p><b>00:16:37.500 - 00:16:40.966</b><br>and so now you probably got a short on right there<br></p><p><b>00:16:40.966 - 00:16:42.666</b><br>you probably didn't get any shorts in this one<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.666 - 00:16:44.400</b><br>because that was such a crazy move<br></p><p><b>00:16:44.700 - 00:16:47.000</b><br>and then you might get a short on right here<br></p><p><b>00:16:47.566 - 00:16:50.000</b><br>but this soldier just got killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:50.066 - 00:16:51.733</b><br>and this soldier just got killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:51.733 - 00:16:53.800</b><br>and this one came down low enough<br></p><p><b>00:16:53.966 - 00:16:57.700</b><br>to kill him so all those soldiers got killed<br></p><p><b>00:16:58.766 - 00:16:59.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:16:59.333 - 00:17:03.933</b><br>throughout this entire whatever two months of hard work<br></p><p><b>00:17:04.533 - 00:17:06.400</b><br>all your soldiers get killed<br></p><p><b>00:17:06.866 - 00:17:07.666</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:17:08.166 - 00:17:09.766</b><br>there's some slippage in there<br></p><p><b>00:17:09.800 - 00:17:10.600</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:17:10.866 - 00:17:14.666</b><br>there's all the ones that hit your stop losses<br></p><p><b>00:17:14.666 - 00:17:17.166</b><br>when you originally took the position on bad entries<br></p><p><b>00:17:17.166 - 00:17:17.733</b><br>and you got hit<br></p><p><b>00:17:17.733 - 00:17:18.766</b><br>your stop losses<br></p><p><b>00:17:18.766 - 00:17:21.300</b><br>so you've built up a bunch of losses<br></p><p><b>00:17:21.300 - 00:17:22.200</b><br>through this whole section<br></p><p><b>00:17:22.200 - 00:17:23.200</b><br>they're all small<br></p><p><b>00:17:23.800 - 00:17:26.700</b><br>but you've built up a bunch of losses and<br></p><p><b>00:17:27.500 - 00:17:29.866</b><br>some slippage and all your soldiers are dead<br></p><p><b>00:17:30.866 - 00:17:31.200</b><br>anyway<br></p><p><b>00:17:31.200 - 00:17:33.900</b><br>so then this thing breaks its trend again right here<br></p><p><b>00:17:33.900 - 00:17:35.066</b><br>it would have broken through<br></p><p><b>00:17:35.066 - 00:17:36.733</b><br>that line from there to there<br></p><p><b>00:17:37.600 - 00:17:39.766</b><br>and so now you're starting to take longs<br></p><p><b>00:17:40.100 - 00:17:42.066</b><br>and you're starting to take longs<br></p><p><b>00:17:42.200 - 00:17:44.200</b><br>and you're starting to take longs and then<br></p><p><b>00:17:44.466 - 00:17:48.100</b><br>over here it almost looks like it's breaking a trend<br></p><p><b>00:17:48.166 - 00:17:49.500</b><br>but then it shoots up<br></p><p><b>00:17:50.300 - 00:17:51.733</b><br>so let's just fast forward<br></p><p><b>00:17:56.133 - 00:17:57.133</b><br>and then you get<br></p><p><b>00:17:57.500 - 00:18:00.366</b><br>a sustained market move higher<br></p><p><b>00:18:00.866 - 00:18:02.300</b><br>and now every<br></p><p><b>00:18:03.200 -

00:18:54.100</b><br>so at some point<br></p><p><b>00:18:55.166 - 00:18:56.966</b><br>this thing gets up so high<br></p><p><b>00:18:57.800 - 00:19:01.133</b><br>that you're so far from those little entries down there<br></p><p><b>00:19:01.566 -

00:20:30.466</b><br>and cover all your losses<br></p><p><b>00:20:30.800 - 00:20:31.600</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:20:31.966 - 00:20:34.600</b><br>all your slippage everything that you have<br></p><p><b>00:20:35.333 -

00:20:46.800</b><br>and he says that he's had soldiers that run for years<br></p><p><b>00:20:47.400 - 00:20:48.200</b><br>where<br></p><p><b>00:20:48.766 - 00:20:50.800</b><br>throughout all of this fight up here<br></p><p><b>00:20:50.800 -

00:21:04.966</b><br>it would be left with maybe a soldier there<br></p><p><b>00:21:05.400 - 00:21:06.200</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:21:07.266 - 00:21:09.333</b><br>and it's hard with this thing in my way<br></p><p><b>00:21:09.900 -

00:21:24.733</b><br>you can imagine that once the<br></p><p><b>00:21:24.766 - 00:21:27.800</b><br>stock once the chart gets all the way down to here<br></p><p><b>00:21:28.733 - 00:21:30.900</b><br>the value of his account is so<br></p><p><b>00:21:31.166 - 00:21:34.600</b><br>extremely skyrocketed that it doesn't even make sense<br></p><p><b>00:21:34.700 - 00:21:37.366</b><br>and then when you're working through this section<br></p><p><b>00:21:37.500 - 00:21:38.966</b><br>which is you know like<br></p><p><b>00:21:39.666 - 00:21:43.866</b><br>over two years of time this is a mad fight<br></p><p><b>00:21:44.500 - 00:21:45.300</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:21:46.700 - 00:21:49.200</b><br>you'll still be able to what he calls diversify<br></p><p><b>00:21:49.200 - 00:21:51.400</b><br>you'll still be able to take off a few soldiers<br></p><p><b>00:21:51.666 - 00:21:54.500</b><br>from here and sell them over here<br></p><p><b>00:21:54.733 - 00:21:58.600</b><br>and cover all your expenses and then still make money<br></p><p><b>00:21:58.700 - 00:22:01.300</b><br>and cover all your expenses and then still make money<br></p><p><b>00:22:01.300 - 00:22:03.733</b><br>until the market actually starts running in one<br></p><p><b>00:22:03.733 - 00:22:05.733</b><br>direction and sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:22:05.900 - 00:22:07.533</b><br>when it comes to currencies<br></p><p><b>00:22:07.533 - 00:22:09.166</b><br>it can run in one direction<br></p><p><b>00:22:09.366 - 00:22:11.533</b><br>for a long time like<br></p><p><b>00:22:11.800 - 00:22:15.100</b><br>in this case that was from the beginning of 2014<br></p><p><b>00:22:15.733 - 00:22:17.666</b><br>for a full year going down<br></p><p><b>00:22:20.933 - 00:22:23.666</b><br>okay so again we're already at 20 minutes on this video<br></p><p><b>00:22:23.733 - 00:22:26.800</b><br>so I understand this is a very simplistic look at his<br></p><p><b>00:22:26.933 - 00:22:29.500</b><br>strategy and you can feel free to go to 4X factory<br></p><p><b>00:22:29.500 - 00:22:31.366</b><br>and I'll put all the links below<br></p><p><b>00:22:31.500 - 00:22:32.766</b><br>so that you can go there<br></p><p><b>00:22:32.766 - 00:22:34.700</b><br>if you want to read more about this<br></p><p><b>00:22:34.800 - 00:22:38.166</b><br>but just to understand how he put the odds in his favor<br></p><p><b>00:22:38.300 - 00:22:39.000</b><br></p><p><b>00:22:39.000 - 00:22:42.266</b><br>he has FXCM has a broker<br></p><p><b>00:22:42.266 - 00:22:45.333</b><br>which individualizes each of these orders and allows<br></p><p><b>00:22:45.333 - 00:22:47.900</b><br>him to be able to put all these multiple orders<br></p><p><b>00:22:48.000 - 00:22:50.700</b><br>both short and long at the same time<br></p><p><b>00:22:50.700 - 00:22:52.266</b><br>and allow the market<br></p><p><b>00:22:52.266 - 00:22:55.066</b><br>to cancel out and break even on his orders<br></p><p><b>00:22:55.600 - 00:22:58.533</b><br>so he allows the market to decide to dictate<br></p><p><b>00:22:58.566 - 00:23:00.500</b><br>which of these soldiers will live<br></p><p><b>00:23:00.500 - 00:23:01.700</b><br>and which will die<br></p><p><b>00:23:02.600 - 00:23:04.133</b><br>and then later on<br></p><p><b>00:23:04.133 - 00:23:06.966</b><br>he only has to sacrifice a few of his soldiers<br></p><p><b>00:23:06.966 - 00:23:07.733</b><br>to make<br></p><p><b>00:23:07.733 - 00:23:09.300</b><br>immense profits<br></p><p><b>00:23:09.333 - 00:23:10.400</b><br>then on top of that<br></p><p><b>00:23:10.400 - 00:23:13.366</b><br>he's using the fact that it's forex so it's leveraged<br></p><p><b>00:23:13.466 - 00:23:15.566</b><br>to be able to take these small positions<br></p><p><b>00:23:15.566 - 00:23:17.600</b><br>and turn them into huge money<br></p><p><b>00:23:17.600 - 00:23:18.733</b><br>into the future<br></p><p><b>00:23:20.300 - 00:23:23.466</b><br>and then as far as risk reward Reef Show goes<br></p><p><b>00:23:23.466 - 00:23:25.166</b><br>he's using that concept<br></p><p><b>00:23:25.166 - 00:23:28.000</b><br>and skewing it so far in his favor<br></p><p><b>00:23:28.133 - 00:23:30.866</b><br>to the point where you know he's risking<br></p><p><b>00:23:30.866 - 00:23:32.266</b><br>it's not 3 to 1<br></p><p><b>00:23:32.466 - 00:23:36.100</b><br>now it's like 1,000 to 1 or 5,000 to 1<br></p><p><b>00:23:36.333 - 00:23:37.666</b><br>so he just he just<br></p><p><b>00:23:37.666 - 00:23:39.000</b><br>turns that on its head<br></p><p><b>00:23:39.666 - 00:23:41.500</b><br>so back when I was studying the system<br></p><p><b>00:23:42.766 - 00:23:47.966</b><br>with FXCM were using MT4 as a platform<br></p><p><b>00:23:48.400 - 00:23:49.866</b><br>which has great charts<br></p><p><b>00:23:49.866 - 00:23:52.300</b><br>and really easy to enter orders and everything<br></p><p><b>00:23:52.600 - 00:23:54.800</b><br>and so I was looking at<br></p><p><b>00:23:55.566 - 00:23:58.566</b><br>why he designed it this way and how it works for him<br></p><p><b>00:23:58.900 - 00:24:00.533</b><br>and so I was trying to use those<br></p><p><b>00:24:00.533 - 00:24:02.733</b><br>principles to come up with my own system<br></p><p><b>00:24:03.466 - 00:24:04.666</b><br>that I could automate<br></p><p><b>00:24:04.666 - 00:24:06.900</b><br>and so I actually hired a programmer<br></p><p><b>00:24:06.933 - 00:24:10.166</b><br>and I got them to write me an EA<br></p><p><b>00:24:10.266 - 00:24:12.966</b><br>which is like an automated bot for MT4<br></p><p><b>00:24:13.333 - 00:24:15.500</b><br>and I tried<br></p><p><b>00:24:15.600 - 00:24:18.533</b><br>to because I didn't have the time to actually dedicate<br></p><p><b>00:24:18.600 - 00:24:21.166</b><br>to try to trade this all day every day<br></p><p><b>00:24:24.066 - 00:24:25.366</b><br>like pipiese does<br></p><p><b>00:24:26.766 - 00:24:27.900</b><br>because I just didn't have the time<br></p><p><b>00:24:27.900 - 00:24:29.533</b><br>because I'm still trading stocks and<br></p><p><b>00:24:29.733 - 00:24:30.466</b><br>penny stocks<br></p><p><b>00:24:30.466 - 00:24:33.466</b><br>and I think at that point I was also doing options and<br></p><p><b>00:24:34.933 - 00:24:37.400</b><br>so I thought maybe I could automate this<br></p><p><b>00:24:37.600 - 00:24:40.100</b><br>but maybe I could put it my own twist on it<br></p><p><b>00:24:40.133 - 00:24:42.966</b><br>and and maybe even tweak it make it a little bit better<br></p><p><b>00:24:43.800 - 00:24:46.300</b><br>and so I did that but then of course<br></p><p><b>00:24:46.400 - 00:24:48.566</b><br>long story short it didn't work out for me<br></p><p><b>00:24:49.600 - 00:24:50.733</b><br>because I gave up<br></p><p><b>00:24:50.733 - 00:24:52.133</b><br>it started to get too costly<br></p><p><b>00:24:52.366 - 00:24:53.800</b><br>with the programmer<br></p><p><b>00:24:53.800 - 00:24:55.766</b><br>you know trying to work out all the little bugs<br></p><p><b>00:24:55.766 - 00:24:57.066</b><br>and I just didn't have time<br></p><p><b>00:24:57.066 - 00:24:58.300</b><br>and so I put on the back burner<br></p><p><b>00:24:58.300 -
