00:00:06.966</b><br>so I thought I'd make a quick video<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.966 - 00:00:08.700</b><br>to talk to you guys about dtube<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.800 - 00:00:10.600</b><br>so I don't know if everybody's heard of dtube<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.600 - 00:00:11.933</b><br>but it's just like YouTube<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.900 - 00:00:14.333</b><br>but it's on blockchain<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.366 - 00:00:15.366</b><br>so that's exciting<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.366 - 00:00:16.666</b><br>and it's only been out for a few days<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.666 - 00:00:18.766</b><br>so if you want to be on the ground floor<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.766 - 00:00:20.500</b><br>of uploading videos to something<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.500 - 00:00:23.100</b><br>to a platform that's only been out for a few days<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.466 - 00:00:25.866</b><br>then go check out dtube I'm<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.866 - 00:00:28.166</b><br>going to start uploading my videos to D22<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.100 - 00:00:31.733</b><br>so I'm going to upload them to YouTube also<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.900 - 00:00:32.766</b><br>because right now<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.766 - 00:00:35.533</b><br>there's so many people that are following me on YouTube<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.700 - 00:00:38.766</b><br>that it drives traffic over to steam it<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.766 - 00:00:39.866</b><br>so that's wonderful<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.866 - 00:00:40.966</b><br>I want to keep doing that<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.566 - 00:00:44.400</b><br>but by posting them on dtube<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.066 - 00:00:47.866</b><br>they're gonna be on blockchain and they're<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.866 - 00:00:49.100</b><br>never gonna go away right<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.100 - 00:00:51.000</b><br>so I'm gonna start doing that<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.000 - 00:00:52.966</b><br>plus I want to support this dtube<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.400 - 00:00:54.366</b><br>thing because<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.100 - 00:00:56.566</b><br>it's just like steam it right<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.566 - 00:00:59.766</b><br>so people can upvote the videos they like<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.933 - 00:01:01.466</b><br>and that pays the person<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.533 - 00:01:01.866</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.866 - 00:01:04.700</b><br>it gives steam to the person who created the videos<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.700 - 00:01:07.733</b><br>and it could you know I mean it's<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.866 - 00:01:10.866</b><br>brand new but it could someday take over YouTube<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.866 - 00:01:12.733</b><br>you know and no matter what<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.800 - 00:01:15.533</b><br>the more traffic that gets drive to D2<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.933 - 00:01:18.333</b><br>promotes steam it and steam it gets bigger<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.333 - 00:01:20.133</b><br>and so that's what we all want right<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.933 - 00:01:21.733</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.333 - 00:01:23.066</b><br>before we do that<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.066 - 00:01:24.266</b><br>let's take a look at some charts<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.266 - 00:01:26.466</b><br>because I just want to talk about trading<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.466 - 00:01:27.200</b><br>because I think<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.200 - 00:01:29.866</b><br>things are about to get interesting with Bitcoin and<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.866 - 00:01:30.666</b><br>Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.333 - 00:01:32.566</b><br>you know they've been kind of<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.133 - 00:01:33.933</b><br>bouncing<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.933 - 00:01:36.966</b><br>along sideways kind of consolidating for a few days<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.533 - 00:01:39.700</b><br>so let's look at those charts but first let's look at<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.766 - 00:01:42.100</b><br>Bitcoin cache right here<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.366 - 00:01:44.700</b><br>and yesterday I made a video<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.700 - 00:01:47.100</b><br>a real quick video was it yesterday or the day before<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.066 - 00:01:51.900</b><br>about you know when I just sold these 880s and<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.200 - 00:01:55.166</b><br>I was playing back and forth over here with my wife<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.166 - 00:01:56.000</b><br>back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.066 - 00:01:57.333</b><br>making these little traits<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.133 - 00:01:59.900</b><br>and then look at this thing start to drop off<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.900 - 00:02:01.666</b><br>and this is a result<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.966 - 00:02:02.400</b><br>like<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.400 - 00:02:04.900</b><br>this is what everybody saying but this is a result of<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.200 - 00:02:06.800</b><br>that Korean thing where<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.366 - 00:02:08.733</b><br>let's see it was over here<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.066 - 00:02:10.866</b><br>over here<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.600 - 00:02:12.566</b><br>yeah right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.933 - 00:02:14.800</b><br>so if you go to bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.933 - 00:02:17.666</b><br>and you look at the markets you'll see that Bitthumb<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.666 - 00:02:19.600</b><br>you know has all the volume<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.600 - 00:02:22.400</b><br>so bitthumb all the volume and then<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.566 - 00:02:23.100</b><br>all the other<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.100 - 00:02:24.933</b><br>exchanges that says very little volume in comparison<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.933 - 00:02:26.366</b><br>right so that was that<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.366 - 00:02:28.900</b><br>Korean exchange that was pumping the price<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.333 - 00:02:31.333</b><br>which never bodes well<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.333 - 00:02:34.066</b><br>for something to continue going when it's just really<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.066 - 00:02:36.166</b><br>one market that's pushing the whole thing up<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.466 - 00:02:37.266</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.366 - 00:02:41.066</b><br>yeah so I'm happy that I'm all out and<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.666 - 00:02:41.966</b><br>I mean<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.966 - 00:02:44.200</b><br>we could start drawing bases and trying to buy in<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.200 - 00:02:44.800</b><br>on the bounces<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.800 - 00:02:46.600</b><br>and it would work because this thing is really bouncy<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.600 - 00:02:47.966</b><br>and there's a lot of movement<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.600 - 00:02:51.500</b><br>another one that's got a lot of movement is Neo<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.500 - 00:02:52.300</b><br>obviously<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.400 - 00:02:55.666</b><br>I don't know why everything is on my screen right here<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.933 - 00:02:58.000</b><br>let me get that off<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.266 - 00:02:59.466</b><br>right there okay<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.366 - 00:03:01.400</b><br>yeah so Neo<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.300 - 00:03:05.133</b><br>has got a lot a lot of buying power<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.966 - 00:03:09.800</b><br>so all these bounces look fantastic so it's really easy<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.966 - 00:03:11.966</b><br>to call this a base right here<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.966 - 00:03:14.333</b><br>and get ready to buy in these 28<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.366 - 00:03:17.200</b><br>so you can see I have alerts here for 26 and 22<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.933 -

00:04:37.500</b><br>is going to be wonderful especially if again<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.500 - 00:04:39.966</b><br>let's just do it this way<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.166 - 00:04:48.000</b><br>again if this thing goes dudes dude dude<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.300 - 00:04:49.100</b><br>kind of goes under<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.100 - 00:04:51.400</b><br>and then does a nice little pop and then comes down<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.400 - 00:04:52.800</b><br>and you know all that kind of stuff<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.800 - 00:04:54.133</b><br>then I'm not participating<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.133 - 00:04:55.366</b><br>you know like that's the kind<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.366 - 00:04:56.933</b><br>of stuff I'm not going to participate in<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.933 - 00:04:57.866</b><br>you can see<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.866 - 00:04:59.966</b><br>I did grab this little drop right here<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.300 - 00:05:01.100</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.366 - 00:05:03.333</b><br>and I was kind of playing a little bit with this<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.333 - 00:05:04.566</b><br>but these were all again<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.566 - 00:05:07.066</b><br>small positions nothing big nothing major<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.600 - 00:05:10.533</b><br>but if all of a sudden if this thing decides to go<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.166 - 00:05:12.400</b><br>a nice big drop<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.933 - 00:05:15.533</b><br>anything under 38 I'm going to start nibbling<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.000 - 00:05:19.200</b><br>and then if we get anywhere near 36 and 35<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.200 - 00:05:19.766</b><br>obviously<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.766 - 00:05:22.333</b><br>I'm going to start to get in some really good size<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.800 - 00:05:25.066</b><br>if we go to drop all the way down to 3000<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.066 - 00:05:27.600</b><br>oh my goodness that would be just fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.600 - 00:05:29.166</b><br>I would load right in<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.266 - 00:05:32.533</b><br>but anyway that's what's happening with bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.533 - 00:05:36.866</b><br>it looks like it could drop any time<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.866 - 00:05:38.400</b><br>this is a very barish<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.466 - 00:05:40.066</b><br>well basically this is a flag right<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.066 - 00:05:41.666</b><br>if you were going to use<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.733 - 00:05:43.933</b><br>regular technical analysis you would be<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.200 - 00:05:46.133</b><br>saying that this is a flag right here<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.166 - 00:05:47.500</b><br>and that could go either way<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.300 - 00:05:49.333</b><br>but I'm<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.400 - 00:05:51.566</b><br>obviously hoping for a little bit of a drop right now<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.566 - 00:05:53.500</b><br>just so I can reload because I did unload<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.500 - 00:05:55.100</b><br>quite a bit of bitcoin lately<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.133 - 00:05:56.333</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.333 - 00:05:57.766</b><br>and the other thing is Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.000 - 00:05:58.300</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.300 - 00:05:59.500</b><br>so here's Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.533 - 00:06:02.066</b><br>you can see that I sold a little bit right here<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.333 - 00:06:03.800</b><br>just over the 300 level<br></p><p><b>00:06:04.066 - 00:06:06.366</b><br>and then I bought back some of it because<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.600 -

00:06:14.266</b><br>follow bitcoin and keep going up<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.333 - 00:06:15.866</b><br>but instead it just consolidated<br></p><p><b>00:06:15.866 - 00:06:17.533</b><br>just consolidated just consolidated<br></p><p><b>00:06:17.533 -

00:07:22.133</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.133 - 00:07:25.133</b><br>I tend to take 30 percent profits on those free coins<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.300 - 00:07:27.133</b><br>but like 30<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.133 - 00:07:28.533</b><br>like I sell 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:07:28.533 - 00:07:30.566</b><br>of the amount of free coins that I have<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.766 - 00:07:32.666</b><br>I should clarify that<br></p><p><b>00:07:33.400 -

00:07:43.366</b><br>but anyway when it moves really hard like this<br></p><p><b>00:07:43.366 - 00:07:44.566</b><br>which is actually in this case<br></p><p><b>00:07:44.566 - 00:07:45.466</b><br>30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:07:46.166 -

00:07:56.533</b><br>so now<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.533 - 00:07:59.166</b><br>you know I'd probably be selling again in the 380<br></p><p><b>00:07:59.166 - 00:08:00.333</b><br>400 range<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.700 -

00:08:09.066</b><br>you know just the trader in me says<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.066 - 00:08:11.000</b><br>oh man this is starting to show strength<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.000 - 00:08:13.400</b><br>and there was so much good news with the theorem<br></p><p><b>00:08:13.400 - 00:08:14.900</b><br>lately that I just decided<br></p><p><b>00:08:14.966 - 00:08:17.300</b><br>just to get a little bit more of my free coins back<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.966 - 00:08:20.000</b><br>I thought I sold just a bit too much here<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.333 - 00:08:22.733</b><br>and of course now it is going up so<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.733 - 00:08:23.900</b><br>that's where we are with that<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.400 - 00:08:26.466</b><br>okay so let's look at dtube here for a second<br></p><p><b>00:08:26.466 - 00:08:28.766</b><br>so it looks a lot like YouTube<br></p><p><b>00:08:29.266 - 00:08:31.800</b><br>and over here it kind of looks like steam it because<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.800 - 00:08:32.133</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.133 - 00:08:33.966</b><br>you have your information over here in the corner<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.966 - 00:08:36.533</b><br>and it works just exactly like steam it where<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.166 - 00:08:38.666</b><br>you know everybody's putting out their<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.933 - 00:08:42.000</b><br>instead of blog posts they're putting out their videos<br></p><p><b>00:08:42.000 - 00:08:43.866</b><br>and people are getting paid for their videos<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.866 - 00:08:44.500</b><br>because people<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.500 - 00:08:45.200</b><br>are uploating them<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.200 - 00:08:47.166</b><br>so it's pretty well exactly the same<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.700 - 00:08:50.700</b><br>only it's going to mean that my videos and everybody<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.700 - 00:08:51.700</b><br>else's videos<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.966 - 00:08:53.133</b><br>are more permanent<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.466 - 00:08:54.266</b><br>in the world<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.700 - 00:08:57.400</b><br>so anyway I uploaded my very first video<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.600 - 00:08:58.966</b><br>that I did a while back<br></p><p><b>00:08:58.966 - 00:09:01.200</b><br>you guys might remember introduction to trading<br></p><p><b>00:09:01.333 - 00:09:02.700</b><br>to this trading series<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.266 - 00:09:06.400</b><br>and so if you click on that it works just like YouTube<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.166 - 00:09:08.933</b><br>it works just like YouTube<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.933 - 00:09:11.100</b><br>you know you get to watch the video and<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.166 - 00:09:12.400</b><br>then you can comment<br></p><p><b>00:09:13.133 - 00:09:15.700</b><br>and there's a little description here of what this<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.700 - 00:09:16.500</b><br>is all about<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.500 -
