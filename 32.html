00:00:47.566</b><br>against tether<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.566 - 00:00:49.866</b><br>which is USD but not really USD<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.866 - 00:00:50.933</b><br>but you know what I mean<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.333 - 00:00:52.966</b><br>its tracking USD price<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.966 - 00:00:54.566</b><br>so this is Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.866 - 00:00:56.333</b><br>versus USD let's just say<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.200 - 00:01:00.166</b><br>and everybody knows from my past videos<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.166 - 00:01:01.100</b><br>that I've been selling<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.100 - 00:01:02.000</b><br>and selling and selling<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.000 - 00:01:02.866</b><br>and selling and selling<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.866 - 00:01:04.266</b><br>and selling and selling bitcoin right<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.333 - 00:01:06.666</b><br>so I've collected free bitcoins<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.666 -

00:01:16.200</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.566 - 00:01:21.933</b><br>well there's a lot of members in our Slack that<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.866 - 00:01:24.400</b><br>they hold bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.066 - 00:01:27.566</b><br>and then they trade bitcoin pairs<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.733 - 00:01:29.266</b><br>to increase their bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.400 - 00:01:31.600</b><br>you know so they're holding bitcoin as their currency<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.700 - 00:01:34.766</b><br>they're not looking at USD value or some theod value<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.966 - 00:01:36.900</b><br>they're holding bitcoin as their currency<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.700 - 00:01:41.400</b><br>and this has been a great strategy for them because<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.733 -
