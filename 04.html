00:00:07.133</b><br>my trading day on the market on the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.866 - 00:00:09.300</b><br>but I just took a trade on<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.200 - 00:00:11.066</b><br>Singulus here<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.200 - 00:00:13.400</b><br>so if you take a look at the Singulus chart<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.733 - 00:00:15.566</b><br>I just wanted to alert you guys about this<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.566 - 00:00:16.866</b><br>because it might dip again<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.866 - 00:00:20.166</b><br>you might get a chance to the actual trait I just took<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.600 - 00:00:22.166</b><br>happened a little too fast for me to be<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.166 - 00:00:23.766</b><br>able to put out some kind of<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.933 - 00:00:26.800</b><br>a video so everybody could quickly see it and<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.200 - 00:00:28.300</b><br>take advantage of it<br></p><p><b>00:00:29.200 - 00:00:30.333</b><br>but at least now<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.500 - 00:00:33.100</b><br>if for the next few hours if it decides to dip again<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.100 - 00:00:34.700</b><br>you have an opportunity to get in<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.900 - 00:00:38.133</b><br>so as you can see simulus over the past<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.333 - 00:00:39.900</b><br>two months over the past two months<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.900 - 00:00:42.133</b><br>look at these moves up and down up and down<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.133 - 00:00:43.600</b><br>it is a very crazy<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.500 - 00:00:46.800</b><br>stock and if we were to start drawing our bases<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.800 - 00:00:48.000</b><br>like we usually do<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.866 - 00:00:52.733</b><br>we'd be you know obviously drawing a base down here<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.900 - 00:00:54.500</b><br>and you'd be drawing a base right here<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.500 - 00:00:56.533</b><br>because look at that reaction bounce<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.600 - 00:00:59.566</b><br>and then of course this would be all beautiful to buy<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.866 - 00:01:01.800</b><br>and then you'd be drawing a base here<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.800 - 00:01:03.733</b><br>because look at that reaction bounce<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.900 - 00:01:04.666</b><br>and you'd be<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.666 - 00:01:06.400</b><br>still drawing that base here and here and here<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.400 - 00:01:08.733</b><br>and then guess what we get a crack of the base<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.000 - 00:01:12.500</b><br>so way down here boom from 66<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.500 - 00:01:13.600</b><br>that beautiful base<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.600 - 00:01:16.266</b><br>we got to crack all the way down to five<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.500 - 00:01:18.700</b><br>so you know that I was layering in there<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.166 - 00:01:21.566</b><br>where is my history<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.500 - 00:01:24.533</b><br>all right so here's the trees that I took<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.966 - 00:01:27.533</b><br>you can see I took a nibble right here at 6<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.533 - 00:01:30.533</b><br>so it dropped from 6 6 down to six I took a nibble<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.933 - 00:01:31.733</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.166 - 00:01:34.966</b><br>if we could even make this 15<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.000 - 00:01:35.533</b><br>minute chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.533 - 00:01:37.266</b><br>it would be a little easier for you guys to see<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.366 - 00:01:39.533</b><br>but I took that initial nibble at 6<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.666 - 00:01:41.300</b><br>and then I got some more<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.566 - 00:01:42.533</b><br>at 54<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.866 - 00:01:46.266</b><br>and then I got some at 52 and then I got some at 5 even<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.733 - 00:01:52.400</b><br>and then I sold the majority at around 57 and 58 so<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.900 - 00:01:55.366</b><br>I'm now sitting on<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.866 - 00:01:58.100</b><br>a quarter of the position that I had<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.566 - 00:02:01.166</b><br>and in case this thing wants to come like it should<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.166 - 00:02:02.900</b><br>all the way back up to its base<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.600 - 00:02:05.166</b><br>or even just a little bit higher<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.166 - 00:02:06.800</b><br>or in case I just decide to hold it<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.800 - 00:02:08.600</b><br>because it's only a quarter of the position<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.600 - 00:02:12.000</b><br>so basically I'm sitting on mainly profits<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.000 - 00:02:12.866</b><br>I might have a<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.166 - 00:02:15.266</b><br>little bit of my own money tied in there<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.400 - 00:02:16.800</b><br>but it's mainly just profits<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.800 - 00:02:19.533</b><br>so that was a beautiful dip and<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.800 - 00:02:21.333</b><br>I decided to show you guys that<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.366 - 00:02:23.166</b><br>so it is very possible<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.166 - 00:02:25.133</b><br>if the news is bad I don't know what the news is<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.133 - 00:02:26.866</b><br>I haven't found any information on it<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.566 - 00:02:29.866</b><br>but it is very possible that this thing could turn over<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.000 - 00:02:33.000</b><br>and then now we have sorry let's go back<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.466 - 00:02:36.100</b><br>now we have a nice space right down here at 5<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.566 - 00:02:39.933</b><br>anything under 5 would be just a beautiful trade<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.966 - 00:02:40.966</b><br>so obviously<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.966 - 00:02:44.000</b><br>I'm going to have orders for fours and threes and<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.100 - 00:02:48.000</b><br>three and a halfs and I saw on liquid exchange<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.800 - 00:02:50.666</b><br>liquid exchange<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.000 - 00:02:52.800</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.466 - 00:02:56.900</b><br>it dropped all the way down to three on that<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.266 - 00:02:59.266</b><br>drop can you imagine if<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.600 - 00:03:02.900</b><br>if I'm not trading on liquid exchange I have like<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.166 - 00:03:06.100</b><br>I've botten a few coins over there here and there just<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.133 - 00:03:08.200</b><br>but not in trading just for investments<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.266 - 00:03:10.333</b><br>like transfer stuff over there or whatever but<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.533 - 00:03:14.166</b><br>man could you imagine if you could have got<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.700 - 00:03:17.266</b><br>even where I got in at 5 and then<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.300 - 00:03:21.200</b><br>everything below 5 all the way down on this spike<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.266 - 00:03:22.400</b><br>all the way down to 3<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.566 - 00:03:23.400</b><br>and then of course<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.533 - 00:03:26.366</b><br>we're getting our balance back to our base right<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.733 - 00:03:28.800</b><br>so anyway that's where I'm gonna leave it off<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.800 - 00:03:30.000</b><br>I just wanted to show you guys that<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.000 - 00:03:31.100</b><br>I just wanted to keep<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.100 - 00:03:31.800</b><br>giving you alerts<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.800 - 00:03:33.466</b><br>when things are happening on the market<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.866 - 00:03:36.933</b><br>when I take a trade and obviously<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.866 - 00:03:39.966</b><br>there's a chance that you guys make it take a trade too<br></p></body></html>
