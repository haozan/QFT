00:00:04.900</b><br>and I checked with my wife<br></p><p><b>00:00:04.900 - 00:00:06.100</b><br>and she's not going to be home for a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.100 - 00:00:08.000</b><br>so I thought I'd pop out a video for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.733 - 00:00:09.933</b><br>lately some<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.966 - 00:00:12.300</b><br>traders that are struggling have been messaging me<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.733 - 00:00:16.166</b><br>traders always are messaging me showing me their charts<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.400 - 00:00:17.200</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.400 - 00:00:19.500</b><br>it seems like<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.166 - 00:00:22.400</b><br>lot of traders have trouble with the account building<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.400 - 00:00:25.566</b><br>trades those are the trades that<br></p><p><b>00:00:26.133 - 00:00:27.133</b><br>go like this<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.800 - 00:00:30.533</b><br>you know where you've got kind of a range going<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.066 - 00:00:32.566</b><br>maybe goes down below the range a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.566 - 00:00:33.800</b><br>that comes back up<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.966 - 00:00:36.600</b><br>so you got basically a general range where you can say<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.600 - 00:00:38.700</b><br>you know this seems to be the base where there's<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.700 - 00:00:40.100</b><br>pliers that are just kind of<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.266 - 00:00:41.600</b><br>holding this price<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.600 - 00:00:42.733</b><br>and this seems to be where<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.733 - 00:00:44.166</b><br>sellers want to get rid of it<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.166 - 00:00:46.266</b><br>so you got like this range that you can play in<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.000 - 00:00:49.133</b><br>so regularly what you'd be doing<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.100 - 00:00:53.566</b><br>is you'd be putting some layers in like this<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.566 - 00:00:57.000</b><br>you know just in some bottom layers<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.000 - 00:00:59.866</b><br>just to catch it in case it decides to spike down low<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.066 - 00:01:02.966</b><br>and then as soon as you catch a little bit over here<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.300 - 00:01:05.300</b><br>then you'd be putting your cells<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.466 - 00:01:07.166</b><br>and you'd start layering in like that<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.166 - 00:01:07.966</b><br>maybe<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.600 - 00:01:09.400</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.500 - 00:01:11.333</b><br>and maybe a few way up high<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.333 - 00:01:13.100</b><br>just in case it sizes the spike high<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.533 - 00:01:14.966</b><br>and then you just keep working this<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.066 - 00:01:20.666</b><br>but often what happens with the struggling traders<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.900 - 00:01:23.066</b><br>is often they'll come in right<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.300 - 00:01:24.100</b><br>here<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.733 - 00:01:26.366</b><br>you know like they see the beautiful chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.366 - 00:01:27.800</b><br>they see this whole thing<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.800 - 00:01:29.766</b><br>and they're like this looks like a great one to trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.766 - 00:01:32.133</b><br>and I agree it does look like a great one to trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.133 - 00:01:33.333</b><br>it'd be awesome if you had been<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.333 - 00:01:34.466</b><br>trading through the whole thing<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.133 - 00:01:36.400</b><br>but anyway they start<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.800 - 00:01:37.766</b><br>off right here<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.100 - 00:01:40.266</b><br>and you know they put in their layers<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.933 - 00:01:41.933</b><br>where's my green<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.600 - 00:01:44.066</b><br>so they put in their layers<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.500 - 00:01:45.733</b><br>and they're getting ready<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.333 - 00:01:47.666</b><br>and then all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.933 - 00:01:51.666</b><br>this thing decides to start going<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.800 - 00:01:56.933</b><br>kind of licking a downward fashion down like that<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.366 - 00:01:59.066</b><br>and they're getting in more<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.066 - 00:01:59.800</b><br>and they're getting in more<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.800 - 00:02:00.800</b><br>and they're getting in more<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.766 - 00:02:03.566</b><br>and then even sometimes<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.600 - 00:02:05.266</b><br>you'll get like a little splake up<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.466 - 00:02:06.700</b><br>and then it'll keep going down<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.700 - 00:02:07.933</b><br>you know like that's usually what it does<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.933 - 00:02:09.200</b><br>it's like a quick splake<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.333 - 00:02:10.700</b><br>and it would clear<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.700 - 00:02:13.133</b><br>all of these bys if you were prepared for that<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.133 - 00:02:13.966</b><br>quick splake<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.066 - 00:02:14.866</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.933 - 00:02:16.533</b><br>things starts working lower and lower and lower<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.533 - 00:02:18.200</b><br>and by the time they come to me<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.766 - 00:02:19.966</b><br>let me just clear this<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.000 - 00:02:26.266</b><br>so by the time they come to me let's say this with our<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.166 - 00:02:28.533</b><br>this again with our chart<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.200 - 00:02:33.100</b><br>and then it started to go lower get a quick spike there<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.733 - 00:02:36.466</b><br>and then you get all this action going down<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.100 - 00:02:38.800</b><br>maybe you get another little quick spike<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.966 - 00:02:40.566</b><br>and then you get all this action going down<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.666 - 00:02:43.000</b><br>and by the time they get to me we're over here<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.500 - 00:02:47.266</b><br>and their average is like something like over there<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.466 - 00:02:50.133</b><br>and they're like now Luke what do I do<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.500 - 00:02:53.400</b><br>you know I'm stuck with an average over here<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.800 - 00:02:54.600</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.700 - 00:02:56.500</b><br>doesn't seem like it's ever gonna get up there again<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.666 - 00:02:58.733</b><br>and I'm like well how in the world did you<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.866 - 00:03:00.800</b><br>end up with an average over there<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.100 - 00:03:03.533</b><br>well because they started buying right<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.366 - 00:03:05.166</b><br>there<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.300 - 00:03:08.333</b><br>and then maybe they didn't get anything<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.600 - 00:03:10.400</b><br>with this spike because<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.933 - 00:03:13.100</b><br>at this point when the spike was here their average was<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.100 - 00:03:14.366</b><br>maybe like right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.933 - 00:03:16.333</b><br>you know between there and there<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.500 - 00:03:18.200</b><br>and their average might have been right there<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.500 - 00:03:21.100</b><br>and they just didn't plan on selling that early<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.266 - 00:03:22.866</b><br>and then the thing gets away from them<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.866 - 00:03:24.066</b><br>and before you know it<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.266 - 00:03:26.966</b><br>you know whereas this was let's call this 10<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.300 - 00:03:29.566</b><br>now we're down to<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.866 - 00:03:31.666</b><br>three<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.000 - 00:03:33.200</b><br>and they're like way<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.266 - 00:03:35.866</b><br>underwater and their average is over here at<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.866 - 00:03:37.100</b><br>let's say seven<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.000 - 00:03:40.600</b><br>and they're like are we actually I just take a law<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.600 - 00:03:42.133</b><br>should I just get out of this thing<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.566 - 00:03:44.533</b><br>what am I gonna do<br></p><p><b>00:03:44.533 - 00:03:47.400</b><br>and meanwhile all of this action<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.466 - 00:03:49.966</b><br>all of this stuff that happened down here<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.866 - 00:03:51.533</b><br>they never<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.533 - 00:03:54.266</b><br>participated in because they were they've been waiting<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.333 - 00:03:55.300</b><br>for this<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.933 - 00:03:57.933</b><br>for this bounce back up<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.933 - 00:04:00.066</b><br>you know to try to get some profit out of this or<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.066 - 00:04:00.866</b><br>something<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.533 - 00:04:02.400</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.333 - 00:04:05.133</b><br>they have<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.166 - 00:04:07.800</b><br>some more orders<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.200 - 00:04:09.733</b><br>underneath here just in case<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.733 - 00:04:10.866</b><br>but they're running out of money<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.866 - 00:04:11.933</b><br>you know like maybe<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.133 - 00:04:13.200</b><br>they only<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.533 - 00:04:15.366</b><br>have a certain small amount of money in their account<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.366 - 00:04:16.366</b><br>and now they're going to<br></p><p><b>00:04:16.600 - 00:04:17.700</b><br>be looking at what<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.700 - 00:04:17.966</b><br>this is<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.966 - 00:04:19.966</b><br>worst case scenario of this thing all of a sudden<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.133 - 00:04:22.666</b><br>decided to fall further down into their<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.666 - 00:04:23.466</b><br>whoops<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.866 - 00:04:28.800</b><br>sorry the camera is right in the way of my<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.800 - 00:04:30.800</b><br>thing here but anyway down into there<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.100 - 00:04:32.600</b><br>oh<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.600 - 00:04:33.700</b><br>that was the wrong button<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.700 - 00:04:34.700</b><br>now in full screen<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.900 - 00:04:35.900</b><br>just a second guys<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.966 - 00:04:40.966</b><br>okay so this looks like a perfect example right of<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.400 - 00:04:44.733</b><br>an AV trade of an account building trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.733 - 00:04:45.466</b><br>you know where<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.466 - 00:04:47.566</b><br>this thing came all the way down to 30 and<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.566 - 00:04:49.333</b><br>then jumped right back up to 45<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.333 - 00:04:50.933</b><br>those percentages are beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.133 - 00:04:53.333</b><br>but anyway if you were to try to call<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.800 - 00:04:55.266</b><br>now you draw on this thing<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.266 - 00:04:57.966</b><br>so if you were saying you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.966 - 00:04:59.866</b><br>here's like the logical place<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.866 - 00:05:01.566</b><br>that all the buyers seem to be sitting<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.366 - 00:05:04.100</b><br>you know you have an opportunity to buy<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.133 - 00:05:05.600</b><br>an opportunity to buy<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.966 - 00:05:08.200</b><br>and maybe a little bit of an oxygen buy<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.333 - 00:05:09.900</b><br>and an oxygen buy<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.900 - 00:05:12.200</b><br>look at all these buys and all these cells<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.200 - 00:05:14.466</b><br>it's just perfect right and then of course<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.733 - 00:05:17.066</b><br>because you saw this nice big spike down to 30<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.166 - 00:05:18.200</b><br>you'd be able to<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.266 - 00:05:19.700</b><br>set in some layers down here<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.700 - 00:05:22.066</b><br>just to catch it in case it's going to fall lower<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.666 - 00:05:25.400</b><br>but these percentages are great<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.766 - 00:05:27.566</b><br>it's beautiful beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.000 - 00:05:29.133</b><br>AB trading<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.200 - 00:05:32.500</b><br>but this person that sent this chart to me<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.566 - 00:05:34.333</b><br>is stuck up at 6<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.533 - 00:05:36.200</b><br>and so they're just watching all of this<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.200 - 00:05:37.400</b><br>action happening<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.400 - 00:05:39.100</b><br>and they're not profiting on it<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.100 - 00:05:41.066</b><br>and they're so they're saying you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.933 - 00:05:42.766</b><br>I've got some<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.766 - 00:05:45.333</b><br>I've got some layers set in really low just<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.766 - 00:05:48.800</b><br>as an encase this happens but I'm stuck up at 6<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.933 - 00:05:51.533</b><br>and should I just be taking a loss now<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.600 - 00:05:53.266</b><br>should I continue working this<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.400 - 00:05:54.533</b><br>and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.533 - 00:05:58.000</b><br>so let's zoom out a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.000 - 00:06:00.133</b><br>and take a look at a bigger picture of this<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.133 - 00:06:01.200</b><br>because we're only looking at<br></p><p><b>00:06:01.200 - 00:06:02.766</b><br>something like a month here<br></p><p><b>00:06:03.600 - 00:06:05.000</b><br>and see what happened<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.200 - 00:06:07.000</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:06:07.066 - 00:06:08.900</b><br>when I asked this person<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.933 -

00:06:19.066</b><br>we move this whole chart back<br></p><p><b>00:06:19.066 - 00:06:20.600</b><br>and just ignore what happened<br></p><p><b>00:06:21.733 - 00:06:23.200</b><br>and we start off there<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.666 - 00:06:25.866</b><br>you'll see that<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.266 - 00:06:28.666</b><br>for an a B trade<br></p><p><b>00:06:28.933 - 00:06:29.500</b><br>for a<br></p><p><b>00:06:29.500 - 00:06:31.333</b><br>B chart it is a little choppy but the<br></p><p><b>00:06:31.333 - 00:06:32.700</b><br>percentages were pretty good<br></p><p><b>00:06:32.800 - 00:06:36.166</b><br>from 8 to 11 over here from<br></p><p><b>00:06:36.600 - 00:06:37.400</b><br></p><p><b>00:06:37.666 - 00:06:39.966</b><br>to 12 over here from<br></p><p><b>00:06:40.933 -

00:06:47.866</b><br>far in between<br></p><p><b>00:06:47.866 - 00:06:48.500</b><br>like look how many<br></p><p><b>00:06:48.500 - 00:06:50.866</b><br>days you are waiting for these little spikes<br></p><p><b>00:06:51.066 - 00:06:54.200</b><br>so I wouldn't be my favorite anyway<br></p><p><b>00:06:54.266 - 00:06:55.966</b><br>like this wouldn't be my favorite but<br></p><p><b>00:06:55.966 - 00:06:56.866</b><br>if I liked<br></p><p><b>00:06:56.866 -

00:07:09.800</b><br>was used this as an example<br></p><p><b>00:07:10.100 - 00:07:12.733</b><br>that that person probably only started here<br></p><p><b>00:07:13.166 - 00:07:15.266</b><br>that was where they took their first trade likely<br></p><p><b>00:07:16.300 - 00:07:18.700</b><br>so then we fast forward to where we are now<br></p><p><b>00:07:19.466 - 00:07:20.266</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:07:21.400 - 00:07:22.600</b><br>let's zoom in a little<br></p><p><b>00:07:23.933 - 00:07:24.566</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:07:24.566 - 00:07:25.666</b><br>let's say this person<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.700 - 00:07:28.700</b><br>bought here expecting to be selling you know up<br></p><p><b>00:07:29.400 -

00:07:42.000</b><br>well by the time they get down to here down to 6<br></p><p><b>00:07:42.366 - 00:07:43.866</b><br>they should be thinking<br></p><p><b>00:07:44.166 - 00:07:46.533</b><br>that this trade is not working out<br></p><p><b>00:07:46.666 - 00:07:49.933</b><br>that now they're in a new range whereas the<br></p><p><b>00:07:50.100 - 00:07:52.466</b><br>range used to be from 8 to 10<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.900 - 00:07:55.366</b><br>now it's from 6 to 8<br></p><p><b>00:07:55.900 - 00:07:57.700</b><br>you know it's a different range now<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.166 - 00:07:59.933</b><br>so once they get to here<br></p><p><b>00:08:00.866 - 00:08:02.200</b><br>what happens when you<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.266 - 00:08:04.000</b><br>when you break lower like that is<br></p><p><b>00:08:04.133 - 00:08:05.733</b><br>your charter showing weakness<br></p><p><b>00:08:05.733 - 00:08:08.766</b><br>you know it was able to keep a constant range<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.866 - 00:08:11.000</b><br>it had a bunch of buyers that were here<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.000 - 00:08:12.566</b><br>that were supporting the price<br></p><p><b>00:08:12.566 - 00:08:14.933</b><br>and now those guys aren't there anymore<br></p><p><b>00:08:14.933 - 00:08:16.800</b><br>the price is starting to decline<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.300 - 00:08:19.000</b><br>it's not safe anymore<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.366 - 00:08:20.733</b><br>and the whole thing<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.733 - 00:08:22.933</b><br>the whole subject matter of this video is going to be<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.933 - 00:08:24.333</b><br>market mathematics<br></p><p><b>00:08:24.466 - 00:08:26.100</b><br>but the whole thing with this<br></p><p><b>00:08:27.066 - 00:08:30.133</b><br>is that you know your odds back here<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.966 - 00:08:34.866</b><br>back here you were able to say<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.866 - 00:08:36.400</b><br>okay 1<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.200 - 00:08:38.000</b><br>two<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.366 - 00:08:39.166</b><br>three<br></p><p><b>00:08:39.700 - 00:08:40.500</b><br></p><p><b>00:08:41.600 - 00:08:42.566</b><br>okay I'm taking<br></p><p><b>00:08:42.566 - 00:08:45.133</b><br>a trade here based on the fact that the past four<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.133 - 00:08:47.900</b><br>trades on the eights would have worked<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.166 - 00:08:50.600</b><br>but now that we're down to here<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.800 - 00:08:57.133</b><br>that those odds are no longer in your favor<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.566 - 00:08:59.366</b><br>something's changed about this<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.200 - 00:09:01.900</b><br>coin so<br></p><p><b>00:09:02.366 - 00:09:04.266</b><br>at this point what you have to be<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.266 - 00:09:07.133</b><br>thinking is I want to break even on this trait<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.133 - 00:09:09.000</b><br>you're no longer trying to<br></p><p><b>00:09:09.000 - 00:09:10.966</b><br>you're not saying okay this is the new range<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.466 - 00:09:13.666</b><br>and I'm going to try to make six<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.533 - 00:09:18.333</b><br>you know maybe your average right here is is 7<br></p><p><b>00:09:18.533 - 00:09:19.866</b><br>where is my drawer<br></p><p><b>00:09:21.166 - 00:09:24.200</b><br>maybe your average right here is something around seven<br></p><p><b>00:09:27.100 - 00:09:28.300</b><br>and you're no longer<br></p><p><b>00:09:28.300 - 00:09:30.900</b><br>thinking okay I'm going to try to make 8 or 9 or 10<br></p><p><b>00:09:31.466 - 00:09:32.700</b><br>now you're thinking<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.733 - 00:09:34.700</b><br>because this wasn't like a quick spike down<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.700 - 00:09:35.966</b><br>like let's say this one<br></p><p><b>00:09:35.966 - 00:09:38.400</b><br>did a quick spike down and a quick spike up<br></p><p><b>00:09:38.400 - 00:09:40.400</b><br>you wouldn't even take that into consideration<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.133 - 00:09:43.466</b><br>you know you'd be back here and you'd be still<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.466 - 00:09:46.333</b><br>hoping to sell tens and you wouldn't even take this<br></p><p><b>00:09:46.566 - 00:09:48.400</b><br>but this is this is a grind<br></p><p><b>00:09:48.400 - 00:09:50.933</b><br>this is grinding down something has changed about<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.066 - 00:09:51.866</b><br>this point<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.966 - 00:09:53.333</b><br>so at this point<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.600 - 00:09:56.933</b><br>if you sell all your position at 7 you're doing good<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.133 - 00:09:59.166</b><br>and this is<br></p><p><b>00:09:59.466 - 00:10:01.966</b><br>where I always always emphasize with everybody<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.966 - 00:10:04.366</b><br>to participate in every bounce<br></p><p><b>00:10:04.366 - 00:10:06.500</b><br>always participate in every bounce<br></p><p><b>00:10:06.533 - 00:10:08.800</b><br>whereas your layers used to be here<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.166 - 00:10:11.066</b><br>your cell layers used to be there<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.300 - 00:10:12.100</b><br>now<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.333 - 00:10:13.333</b><br>can I switch this<br></p><p><b>00:10:14.566 - 00:10:17.000</b><br>okay so whereas your cell layers used to be there<br></p><p><b>00:10:17.400 - 00:10:19.533</b><br>now your cell layers are going to be here<br></p><p><b>00:10:21.733 - 00:10:23.933</b><br>because at best<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.933 - 00:10:24.766</b><br>you're considering that<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.766 - 00:10:26.066</b><br>this is going to be a new range<br></p><p><b>00:10:26.066 - 00:10:27.500</b><br>starting to bounce off 6<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.666 - 00:10:31.666</b><br>at worst this is a downwards trend that's developing<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.666 - 00:10:33.800</b><br>and so this thing is just going to keep on going down<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.800 - 00:10:35.533</b><br>and it does right so<br></p><p><b>00:10:37.333 - 00:10:41.166</b><br>the professional move the best move market mathematics<br></p><p><b>00:10:41.166 - 00:10:42.533</b><br>which we'll talk about soon<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.933 - 00:10:45.066</b><br>would be just sell out at 7<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.400 - 00:10:47.966</b><br>try to re buy back in at 6<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.266 - 00:10:50.700</b><br>you know hoping that this is going to be the new<br></p><p><b>00:10:52.066 - 00:10:54.400</b><br>the new range that you're going to start working<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.566 - 00:10:55.266</b><br>and then when it<br></p><p><b>00:10:55.266 - 00:10:57.066</b><br>cracks that then you're even more<br></p><p><b>00:10:57.066 - 00:10:59.333</b><br>thinking wow this is really falling apart<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.466 - 00:11:03.700</b><br>and again if you're starting to layer or is my green<br></p><p><b>00:11:05.066 - 00:11:08.966</b><br>again if you sold all right here at 7<br></p><p><b>00:11:09.066 - 00:11:09.766</b><br>and you<br></p><p><b>00:11:09.766 - 00:11:12.366</b><br>decided here is where I'm going to start buying again<br></p><p><b>00:11:12.800 - 00:11:14.300</b><br>so you buy a little bit here<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.300 - 00:11:15.400</b><br>and you buy a little bit here<br></p><p><b>00:11:15.400 - 00:11:16.900</b><br>and you're layering all the way down<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.066 - 00:11:18.466</b><br>once you get down to four<br></p><p><b>00:11:19.300 - 00:11:20.533</b><br>now you're starting to think okay<br></p><p><b>00:11:20.533 - 00:11:22.133</b><br>my brake Cuban is five<br></p><p><b>00:11:22.766 - 00:11:24.566</b><br>I'm going to again sell<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.566 - 00:11:27.133</b><br>everything a break even if we get to 5<br></p><p><b>00:11:27.566 - 00:11:29.500</b><br>you know like you're playing defense now<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.566 - 00:11:33.166</b><br>because the chart is no longer giving you odds<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.400 - 00:11:37.300</b><br>and the secret to trading is knowing your odds<br></p><p><b>00:11:39.500 - 00:11:42.066</b><br>okay so let's move the chart over a little bit more<br></p><p><b>00:11:42.166 - 00:11:43.366</b><br>and we'll see that<br></p><p><b>00:11:43.900 - 00:11:44.900</b><br>from four<br></p><p><b>00:11:45.266 - 00:11:47.400</b><br>you did get a bounce back up to five<br></p><p><b>00:11:47.400 - 00:11:49.600</b><br>so you did get a chance to clear yourself<br></p><p><b>00:11:49.800 - 00:11:51.766</b><br>but even if you missed that chance<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.800 - 00:11:54.400</b><br>then it gets all the way down to 29<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.933 - 00:11:57.266</b><br>so your where is your<br></p><p><b>00:11:58.100 - 00:11:59.333</b><br>where is my drawer<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.466 - 00:12:01.266</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:12:01.366 - 00:12:02.966</b><br>you know if you hopefully you<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.966 - 00:12:05.533</b><br>cleared yourself and then you rebought at four<br></p><p><b>00:12:05.933 - 00:12:07.400</b><br>but even if you didn't<br></p><p><b>00:12:07.966 - 00:12:10.300</b><br>you would have probably got at least three<br></p><p><b>00:12:10.466 - 00:12:13.000</b><br>and maybe 3 5 and maybe<br></p><p><b>00:12:13.500 - 00:12:15.300</b><br>you brought your average down to like<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.300 - 00:12:17.200</b><br>4 or 5 or something at this point<br></p><p><b>00:12:17.966 - 00:12:20.266</b><br>so let's say your average is 4 or 5 now<br></p><p><b>00:12:20.366 - 00:12:22.400</b><br>you missed that first one which<br></p><p><b>00:12:23.066 - 00:12:25.000</b><br>I don't think you should have but let's say you did<br></p><p><b>00:12:25.200 - 00:12:27.600</b><br>and your average is now 4 or five<br></p><p><b>00:12:28.000 -

00:14:05.133</b><br>I'm just trying to emphasize with everybody<br></p><p><b>00:14:05.200 - 00:14:06.966</b><br>that this is all<br></p><p><b>00:14:07.133 - 00:14:09.500</b><br>math I mean there was a time<br></p><p><b>00:14:09.733 - 00:14:12.133</b><br>in the past where they didn't even have the charts<br></p><p><b>00:14:12.133 - 00:14:13.566</b><br>where they didn't have the software<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.566 - 00:14:16.300</b><br>and traders were just doing the math<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.600 -

00:14:27.366</b><br>okay right now<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.533 - 00:14:28.166</b><br>because everything<br></p><p><b>00:14:28.166 - 00:14:30.566</b><br>is visual and we have these beautiful charts<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.600 -

00:14:41.300</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:14:41.300 - 00:14:43.466</b><br>this is all math and if you can<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.466 - 00:14:44.400</b><br>understand the math<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.400 - 00:14:46.666</b><br>the principles behind what you're doing<br></p><p><b>00:14:47.333 -

00:14:57.766</b><br>understanding odds<br></p><p><b>00:14:59.500 - 00:15:01.000</b><br>so again in this example<br></p><p><b>00:15:01.000 - 00:15:02.200</b><br>your odds<br></p><p><b>00:15:05.100 - 00:15:06.866</b><br>start out over here you were<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.066 -

00:15:32.333</b><br>and then if it was to hold this<br></p><p><b>00:15:32.333 - 00:15:33.800</b><br>and this is your new byline<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.800 - 00:15:35.066</b><br>if it was to hold this<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.466 -

00:15:41.666</b><br>again<br></p><p><b>00:15:41.900 - 00:15:45.166</b><br>you're only looking to break even on your next trade<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.333 - 00:15:46.133</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:15:47.800 -

00:16:26.533</b><br>and then the one you're taking<br></p><p><b>00:16:26.966 - 00:16:29.400</b><br>you know so you know your odds are really really strong<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.400 - 00:16:31.200</b><br>and then likely you're gonna get a win<br></p><p><b>00:16:31.466 - 00:16:33.300</b><br>and then likely you're gonna get another win<br></p><p><b>00:16:33.300 - 00:16:35.266</b><br>and then maybe you'll get a loose<br></p><p><b>00:16:35.466 - 00:16:37.166</b><br>but if you make your lose<br></p><p><b>00:16:37.166 - 00:16:40.666</b><br>break even because there still are rules to a chart<br></p><p><b>00:16:40.700 - 00:16:41.933</b><br>and generally<br></p><p><b>00:16:41.966 - 00:16:43.666</b><br>it will try to make that bounce<br></p><p><b>00:16:43.666 - 00:16:45.933</b><br>right back up to its previous base<br></p><p><b>00:16:47.466 - 00:16:51.366</b><br>you'll get out even and maybe your loses might be 0<br></p><p><b>00:16:52.466 - 00:16:55.166</b><br>or one you know or negative one<br></p><p><b>00:16:55.700 -

00:17:56.366</b><br>oh man this is fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:17:56.500 - 00:17:57.500</b><br>but when it comes<br></p><p><b>00:17:57.500 - 00:18:00.100</b><br>back to the chart and you're looking at this chart<br></p><p><b>00:18:01.200 - 00:18:03.000</b><br>it can get hairy pretty fast<br></p><p><b>00:18:03.000 - 00:18:04.533</b><br>it's not quite as simple<br></p><p><b>00:18:04.533 - 00:18:06.933</b><br>and it's very easy for me to take a chart<br></p><p><b>00:18:06.933 - 00:18:08.700</b><br>and look back in the past and say<br></p><p><b>00:18:08.700 - 00:18:09.933</b><br>this is where you should have got out<br></p><p><b>00:18:09.933 - 00:18:11.166</b><br>and this is where you should have got out<br></p><p><b>00:18:11.866 -
