00:01:16.066</b><br>I just sold it because back here<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.166 - 00:01:19.300</b><br>you know block time was three hours and<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.566 - 00:01:22.966</b><br>there was nobody was supporting Bitcoin cache<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.100 - 00:01:25.100</b><br>there was barely any miners<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.200 - 00:01:26.000</b><br>and now<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.000 - 00:01:29.300</b><br>as of yesterday the difficulty for<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.500 - 00:01:32.466</b><br>mining Bitcoin cash became equal with Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.866 - 00:01:35.000</b><br>so all of a sudden is just as profitable<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.000 - 00:01:36.500</b><br>to mine Bitcoin cash<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.500 - 00:01:39.933</b><br>and so and then there's some rumor that in Korea<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.766 - 00:01:43.666</b><br>there's an exchange that's pumping this or something<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.666 - 00:01:45.100</b><br>I don't know but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.533 - 00:01:47.566</b><br>then you have this crazy take off and<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.500 - 00:01:51.000</b><br>you could if you sold your Bitcoin cash like I did<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.000 - 00:01:51.966</b><br>you could be like<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.966 - 00:01:53.166</b><br>oh man<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.266 - 00:01:54.066</b><br>that's you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.066 - 00:01:56.400</b><br>however many thousands of dollars I missed out on<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.666 - 00:01:59.300</b><br>can't believe that I'm not participating in this and<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.800 - 00:02:01.400</b><br>you can beat yourself up over that<br></p><p><b>00:02:02.466 - 00:02:06.933</b><br>but see the way I trade is I only buy safe<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.000 - 00:02:11.400</b><br>I only buy where I know the odds are greatly screwed<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.533 - 00:02:12.333</b><br>in my<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.933 - 00:02:14.733</b><br>favor<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.066 - 00:02:18.566</b><br>so if I was to buy right now at 580<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.733 - 00:02:20.900</b><br>that would not be skewed in my favorite at all<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.900 - 00:02:23.900</b><br>that would be this thing could drop at any time<br></p><p><b>00:02:23.966 - 00:02:26.733</b><br>look at the last time it hit 580 just a few minutes ago<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.000 - 00:02:28.000</b><br>let's put this on a 15<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.000 - 00:02:30.166</b><br>minute chart so it's a little more clear<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.133 - 00:02:35.366</b><br>you know if you'd got in right there at 580 in<br></p><p><b>00:02:35.666 - 00:02:36.966</b><br>in a few hours<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.966 - 00:02:38.766</b><br>you'd have been all the way down to 455<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.766 - 00:02:40.300</b><br>and wondering if this thing's going to tank<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.300 - 00:02:41.666</b><br>all the way back down to 300<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.400 - 00:02:45.133</b><br>so that's a danger that kind of trading is danger<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.300 - 00:02:47.000</b><br>now you can day trade this<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.000 - 00:02:47.933</b><br>you know you could<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.133 - 00:02:51.500</b><br>see that 580 and then try buying in a little<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.766 - 00:02:53.066</b><br>bit over here for fun<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.266 - 00:02:54.766</b><br>you can day trade for fun<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.000 - 00:02:56.500</b><br>but you can't take position size<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.500 - 00:02:57.933</b><br>you can't go size on this<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.200 - 00:02:59.266</b><br>because that's just<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.600 - 00:03:02.600</b><br>almost gambling and dangerous and that<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.600 - 00:03:04.166</b><br>you just can't trade that way<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.466 - 00:03:06.933</b><br>so this is just another example of how<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.933 - 00:03:08.300</b><br>not to lose your head<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.333 -

00:03:22.766</b><br>you know don't dream up those situations<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.766 - 00:03:24.266</b><br>and then on the other side of the coin<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.266 - 00:03:26.000</b><br>don't put yourself in harm's way<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.133 - 00:03:28.133</b><br>by trying to participate in something<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.566 - 00:03:29.266</b><br>that could<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.266 - 00:03:31.733</b><br>go wow that's gonna be a big trade just a second<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.733 -
