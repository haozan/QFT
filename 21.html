00:01:22.266</b><br>39s because the 4000 is another psychological level<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.466 - 00:01:24.766</b><br>and then when it dips down to 35 or 34<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.966 - 00:01:27.766</b><br>you know I get back in and I'm just playing<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.766 - 00:01:29.300</b><br>this is just me playing<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.300 - 00:01:31.900</b><br>if you take the if you take the arrows off the<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.333 - 00:01:34.100</b><br>chart here let's just go<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.066 - 00:01:35.866</b><br>hide<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.866 - 00:01:38.100</b><br>no sorry that was the wrong one<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.100 - 00:01:39.400</b><br>hide open orders<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.400 - 00:01:40.200</b><br>yeah okay<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.466 - 00:01:42.166</b><br>so if you take the arrows off the charts<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.166 - 00:01:45.800</b><br>you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.933 - 00:01:48.600</b><br>okay let's put this to a four hour<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.600 - 00:01:51.100</b><br>so it really really we really look back<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.466 - 00:01:53.866</b><br>like look at these moves right so<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.100 - 00:01:56.466</b><br>when we were way down here at 900<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.466 - 00:01:59.266</b><br>you got to think kind of logarithmically<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.300 - 00:02:00.766</b><br>I guess is the word<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.866 - 00:02:01.700</b><br>when when you're<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.733 - 00:02:03.000</b><br>when you're at 900<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.000 - 00:02:06.866</b><br>and you run all the way up to let's say right here 1800<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.966 - 00:02:08.366</b><br>so you've doubled<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.366 - 00:02:10.333</b><br>you've doubled your your money right<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.900 - 00:02:11.866</b><br>so that<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.900 - 00:02:14.766</b><br>that hundred percent move that's a pretty big move<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.900 - 00:02:15.466</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.466 - 00:02:16.700</b><br>if I was watching<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.700 - 00:02:19.166</b><br>this move happened and I remember I did it<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.500 - 00:02:20.766</b><br>if I was watching this move happened<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.766 - 00:02:22.533</b><br>I'd be pretty quick to sell those<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.533 - 00:02:24.366</b><br>18s and I did sell some at 18<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.400 - 00:02:28.666</b><br>way way way back when and I remember I sold some at 18<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.700 - 00:02:31.066</b><br>and then it ran away from me<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.133 - 00:02:33.333</b><br>and it went all the way up to 25<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.533 - 00:02:34.766</b><br>and so I sold some more<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.766 - 00:02:38.066</b><br>I sold some 22s I sold some 24s I sold some 25<br></p><p><b>00:02:39.333 - 00:02:40.533</b><br>I remember this whole<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.533 - 00:02:42.400</b><br>this whole thing and I'm like man I can't believe<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.400 - 00:02:44.500</b><br>that we ran 100%<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.066 - 00:02:46.200</b><br>and then we kept running<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.200 - 00:02:47.466</b><br>you know like it barely<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.466 - 00:02:49.666</b><br>gave us a pull back maybe down to like 16<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.733 - 00:02:51.000</b><br>from 18 to 16<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.400 - 00:02:52.600</b><br>how do you time that<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.933 - 00:02:55.000</b><br>you know like you can't you can't think<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.000 - 00:02:56.466</b><br>18's the top I'm gonna<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.800 - 00:02:58.766</b><br>it's just impossible to do so<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.266 - 00:03:01.400</b><br>that's why you gotta keep those baby treats<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.400 - 00:03:02.333</b><br>like you can play<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.333 - 00:03:04.666</b><br>around and that's what I'm doing up there right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.733 - 00:03:06.366</b><br>but it's just baby treats<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.366 - 00:03:09.466</b><br>like I remember selling just a little bit at that 18<br></p><p><b>00:03:09.766 - 00:03:10.800</b><br>watching go to 16<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.800 - 00:03:12.266</b><br>not getting in on time<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.366 - 00:03:12.933</b><br>and then it<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.933 - 00:03:14.933</b><br>runs away from me and it goes all the way up<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.933 - 00:03:17.066</b><br>so I sold some 22s 24s 25<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.066 - 00:03:19.600</b><br>and then we got this huge spike down to 1200<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.766 - 00:03:22.000</b><br>you know like this massive spike because<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.000 - 00:03:23.266</b><br>everybody is out of<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.266 - 00:03:25.100</b><br>control on this buying frenzy<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.366 - 00:03:27.166</b><br>and then we got this huge spike down this<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.166 - 00:03:28.333</b><br>nice big panic and I got<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.333 - 00:03:30.866</b><br>all my shares back at an even cheaper price<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.866 - 00:03:32.366</b><br>and it was just wonderful right<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.200 - 00:03:34.800</b><br>and then we went through all of this stuff<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.800 - 00:03:36.166</b><br>which we've all done together<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.166 - 00:03:38.700</b><br>and we've seen all these beautiful trades<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.300 - 00:03:39.600</b><br>making<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.600 - 00:03:42.500</b><br>tons of bitcoins and profits and then we got this<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.500 - 00:03:43.400</b><br>now we got this huge run<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.400 - 00:03:43.566</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.566 - 00:03:45.866</b><br>if you're looking at it in the big picture of things<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.100 - 00:03:47.733</b><br>I mean we were just at 18<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.100 - 00:03:50.100</b><br>like two weeks ago we were at 18<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.866 - 00:03:52.900</b><br>and now we're at<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.133 - 00:03:55.766</b><br>when we pass 36 that's again doubling<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.966 - 00:03:57.933</b><br>you know like that just doubled itself<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.933 - 00:03:58.866</b><br>just like when we were at<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.866 - 00:04:01.166</b><br>900 here and we doubled ourselves to 18<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.700 - 00:04:02.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.700 - 00:04:06.100</b><br>you know and then when we thought oh man<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.100 - 00:04:07.533</b><br>this is getting a little choppy<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.533 - 00:04:08.766</b><br>this is getting a little high<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.766 - 00:04:10.300</b><br>I can't I don't know if it can go any higher<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.366 - 00:04:13.666</b><br>whoo it took all the way up to 25 26<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.700 - 00:04:17.133</b><br>which means that this could easily go to 5 or 6,000<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.366 - 00:04:19.000</b><br>easily so<br></p><p><b>00:04:19.566 - 00:04:20.766</b><br>even though I'm taking those<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.766 - 00:04:23.333</b><br>trades up there and I'm dirtying up the chart with<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.000 - 00:04:26.066</b><br>I sell here and I buy here and I sell here<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.266 - 00:04:27.066</b><br>just<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.533 - 00:04:28.866</b><br>understand those are baby trades<br></p><p><b>00:04:28.866 - 00:04:31.000</b><br>and that has nothing to do with my method<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.000 - 00:04:32.666</b><br>that's just the trader in me<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.166 - 00:04:35.733</b><br>in Bitcoin I mean in Ethereum right now<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.900 - 00:04:38.733</b><br>if you go over to Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.700 - 00:04:41.500</b><br>okay sorry let's just put those<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.933 - 00:04:45.066</b><br>let's just put those<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.733 - 00:04:46.766</b><br>arrows back on<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.966 - 00:04:48.100</b><br>so you go back to Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.100 - 00:04:51.733</b><br>you can see that I sold some here at 3010 310<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.800 - 00:04:54.466</b><br>maybe 305 and 310<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.533 - 00:04:55.666</b><br>I sold some up there<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.066 - 00:04:59.900</b><br>again I did not participate in this whole run up<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.133 - 00:05:03.666</b><br>and now as Bitcoin continues to head higher<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.400 - 00:05:06.000</b><br>ethereum is not following suit<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.400 - 00:05:08.966</b><br>ethereum kind of ran along with it for a little piece<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.966 - 00:05:10.533</b><br>and then it kind of got stuck<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.600 - 00:05:11.933</b><br>around the 300 level<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.700 - 00:05:16.066</b><br>and just and just having trouble breaking out of that<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.266 - 00:05:17.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.866 - 00:05:18.533</b><br>anyway<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.533 - 00:05:20.866</b><br>because it's pause this is a<br></p><p><b>00:05:21.133 - 00:05:22.933</b><br>kind of a detrading mentality<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.100 - 00:05:24.200</b><br>but when things<br></p><p><b>00:05:24.200 - 00:05:26.600</b><br>kind of pause then<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.966 - 00:05:28.400</b><br>people start to get nervous<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.400 - 00:05:30.766</b><br>and that's sometimes when things turn around<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.333 - 00:05:33.866</b><br>so when I see pauses like this then I sell a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.000 - 00:05:35.533</b><br>but trust me again<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.600 - 00:05:38.366</b><br>these are just baby cells I didn't sell<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.500 - 00:05:40.000</b><br>very much of my Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.066 - 00:05:43.000</b><br>I mean if this thing ran really quick to 400<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.000 - 00:05:47.100</b><br>to that level that major psychological level 400<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.333 -

00:10:25.000</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.000 - 00:10:27.200</b><br>so I actually copied and pasted this right<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.200 - 00:10:28.200</b><br>directly from<br></p><p><b>00:10:28.333 -

00:10:37.866</b><br>example of what could have happened and what<br></p><p><b>00:10:38.500 - 00:10:40.266</b><br>where I would take profit so basically<br></p><p><b>00:10:40.366 - 00:10:42.666</b><br>the way I do it is I take 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.366 - 00:10:45.200</b><br>off of the<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.733 - 00:10:49.966</b><br>investment that exists at the moment so some<br></p><p><b>00:10:50.300 - 00:10:53.933</b><br>people will either take their entire profit<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.000 - 00:10:55.566</b><br>the thing went up 10x or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:10:55.566 - 00:10:56.700</b><br>and they take their whole profit<br></p><p><b>00:10:57.066 - 00:10:59.866</b><br>or some people take half and hold half<br></p><p><b>00:11:00.100 - 00:11:03.933</b><br>and then in this example let's say you had 50 bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.066 - 00:11:05.766</b><br>they'll sell 25 bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:11:05.900 - 00:11:07.100</b><br>and then they'll wait<br></p><p><b>00:11:07.133 - 00:11:08.700</b><br>and later on they'll sell their other<br></p><p><b>00:11:08.700 - 00:11:10.566</b><br>25 bitcoin and then they're out of the game<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.966 - 00:11:13.800</b><br>but what I do is I take 30 percent off of<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.866 - 00:11:16.866</b><br>the investment that exists<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.100 - 00:11:19.400</b><br>and this allows me also to stay<br></p><p><b>00:11:20.566 - 00:11:21.733</b><br>uninvolved<br></p><p><b>00:11:21.866 -

00:11:28.866</b><br>that initial investment<br></p><p><b>00:11:30.133 - 00:11:33.066</b><br>in this example let's say that you started back where<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.066 - 00:11:33.966</b><br>I started<br></p><p><b>00:11:34.533 - 00:11:36.200</b><br>but you had more money than me<br></p><p><b>00:11:36.200 - 00:11:38.300</b><br>I only started with 300 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.500 - 00:11:40.900</b><br>let's say you bought 50 bitcoin and<br></p><p><b>00:11:41.366 -

00:11:51.700</b><br>so on that first run up that we just looked at in the<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.700 - 00:11:54.366</b><br>in the previous chart where it ran up to $900<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.533 - 00:11:56.866</b><br>that would turn your twelve hundred and fifty dollar<br></p><p><b>00:11:56.966 -

00:12:04.066</b><br>you're like oh man<br></p><p><b>00:12:04.100 - 00:12:05.366</b><br>this thing could fall on me<br></p><p><b>00:12:05.733 - 00:12:07.500</b><br>just like it did back when it was at<br></p><p><b>00:12:07.500 - 00:12:10.066</b><br>you know $1,000 before and then it dropped<br></p><p><b>00:12:10.133 - 00:12:11.566</b><br>well now we're at 900<br></p><p><b>00:12:11.566 - 00:12:14.366</b><br>and he is it gonna drop down to $100 again<br></p><p><b>00:12:14.500 - 00:12:15.566</b><br>yeah right<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.766 - 00:12:18.466</b><br>so what you do is you're feeling nervous so you sell<br></p><p><b>00:12:18.466 - 00:12:19.400</b><br>30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:12:19.800 - 00:12:21.733</b><br>so when you sell 30 percent that gives you<br></p><p><b>00:12:21.733 - 00:12:24.700</b><br>13 thousand five hundred that's more money<br></p><p><b>00:12:24.766 - 00:12:26.600</b><br>than you originally even invested<br></p><p><b>00:12:26.900 - 00:12:28.533</b><br>so now you're feeling pretty comfortable<br></p><p><b>00:12:28.533 - 00:12:29.600</b><br>you've got your money back<br></p><p><b>00:12:29.600 - 00:12:31.700</b><br>you've got to leave in a little bit of profit on that<br></p><p><b>00:12:31.866 - 00:12:33.566</b><br>and you can breathe of it<br></p><p><b>00:12:34.400 - 00:12:36.600</b><br>so then all of a sudden the thing falls<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.600 - 00:12:38.400</b><br>down to like 600 bucks<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.566 - 00:12:40.733</b><br>and okay you know<br></p><p><b>00:12:41.266 - 00:12:43.366</b><br>at least you took that profit and you're<br></p><p><b>00:12:43.366 - 00:12:46.500</b><br>and you're not as upset about the fact that you<br></p><p><b>00:12:46.800 - 00:12:47.533</b><br>you had<br></p><p><b>00:12:47.533 - 00:12:49.166</b><br>that much profit and then<br></p><p><b>00:12:49.166 - 00:12:50.333</b><br>it fell back on you<br></p><p><b>00:12:50.333 - 00:12:52.500</b><br>and you just did nothing you didn't participate<br></p><p><b>00:12:52.500 - 00:12:54.700</b><br>and participating is one of the biggest things in<br></p><p><b>00:12:54.700 - 00:12:56.766</b><br>trading and investing<br></p><p><b>00:12:56.900 - 00:12:59.366</b><br>participating really helps you grow your money<br></p><p><b>00:12:59.600 - 00:13:01.466</b><br>so anyway let's say it falls back to<br></p><p><b>00:13:01.466 - 00:13:03.466</b><br>600 dollars and then it gets its nice<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.466 - 00:13:05.166</b><br>big run and we looked at that run<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.366 - 00:13:07.666</b><br>that took you all the way up to 2400<br></p><p><b>00:13:08.666 - 00:13:11.866</b><br>well at 2400 your 35 bitcoin that you have left<br></p><p><b>00:13:11.966 - 00:13:14.133</b><br>from your initial 50 you sold 15<br></p><p><b>00:13:14.700 - 00:13:16.366</b><br>so you got 35 left<br></p><p><b>00:13:16.366 - 00:13:19.566</b><br>and that's now worth 84 thousand dollars<br></p><p><b>00:13:19.900 - 00:13:22.300</b><br>again you're starting to feel that hot potato feeling<br></p><p><b>00:13:22.366 - 00:13:25.300</b><br>so you sell 30 percent of what you have<br></p><p><b>00:13:25.933 - 00:13:28.566</b><br>right so you sell 30 percent that's that's 10<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.733 - 00:13:30.100</b><br>bit point 10.5<br></p><p><b>00:13:30.133 - 00:13:33.166</b><br>and that's 25 thousand two hundred in your pocket<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.500 - 00:13:35.966</b><br>so now you've taken that 30 percent you start to feel<br></p><p><b>00:13:35.966 - 00:13:38.500</b><br>safe again like oh well it's not that big of a deal<br></p><p><b>00:13:38.500 - 00:13:40.566</b><br>if it decides to fall on me maybe it'll go higher<br></p><p><b>00:13:40.566 - 00:13:42.066</b><br>I don't know I'm an investor<br></p><p><b>00:13:42.666 - 00:13:43.966</b><br>but you take the 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:13:44.733 - 00:13:47.766</b><br>so that still leaves you with 24.5 bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:13:49.100 - 00:13:50.133</b><br>and then of course<br></p><p><b>00:13:50.133 - 00:13:53.666</b><br>it drops all the way down like we looked at I put 1400<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.900 - 00:13:58.166</b><br>yeah 14 dish but really dropped down 12 ish but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.200 - 00:14:00.366</b><br>it drops down to 14 but you're not<br></p><p><b>00:14:00.366 - 00:14:02.000</b><br>as hurt by the whole thing<br></p><p><b>00:14:02.000 - 00:14:03.666</b><br>or feeling bad as an investor<br></p><p><b>00:14:03.666 - 00:14:05.266</b><br>you're able to hold a little bit easier<br></p><p><b>00:14:05.333 - 00:14:07.166</b><br>because now you've taken that that<br></p><p><b>00:14:07.166 - 00:14:09.066</b><br>25 thousand dollar profit<br></p><p><b>00:14:09.133 - 00:14:10.200</b><br>and you've also<br></p><p><b>00:14:10.200 - 00:14:11.533</b><br>beforehand you've taken that<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.533 - 00:14:13.366</b><br>13 thousand dollar profit you're<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.366 - 00:14:14.166</b><br>sitting pretty<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.300 - 00:14:16.100</b><br>and then later<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.100 - 00:14:17.000</b><br>what it just did now<br></p><p><b>00:14:17.000 - 00:14:18.933</b><br>it runs to thirty five hundred dollars<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.466 - 00:14:25.366</b><br>and so now you're 24.5 bitcoiner worth $85,750 again<br></p><p><b>00:14:25.966 - 00:14:27.100</b><br>so what do you do<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.466 - 00:14:28.933</b><br>well if you're an investor you can<br></p><p><b>00:14:28.933 - 00:14:31.000</b><br>you starting to feel that hot potato feeling<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.366 - 00:14:32.733</b><br>you take 30 percent again<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.000 - 00:14:35.966</b><br>and when you take 3% that gives you 25 thousand<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.966 - 00:14:36.566</b><br>seven hundred and<br></p><p><b>00:14:36.566 - 00:14:38.333</b><br>twenty five and it still leaves you with 17<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.333 - 00:14:39.600</b><br>bitcoin and<br></p><p><b>00:14:39.600 - 00:14:42.533</b><br>and you just you can continue to participate<br></p><p><b>00:14:42.533 - 00:14:44.166</b><br>over and over and over<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.333 - 00:14:44.900</b><br>now<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.900 - 00:14:48.200</b><br>if you had split your bitcoin up to two or into three<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.300 - 00:14:49.166</b><br>and just sold<br></p><p><b>00:14:49.166 - 00:14:51.733</b><br>three times or two times you'd be out of the game<br></p><p><b>00:14:51.966 - 00:14:54.333</b><br>it'd be over you took your profits you're out<br></p><p><b>00:14:54.466 - 00:14:56.000</b><br>and now you're watching this whole thing<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.000 - 00:14:59.200</b><br>go to 10,000 or $100,000 a coin<br></p><p><b>00:14:59.400 - 00:15:01.800</b><br>without you but because<br></p><p><b>00:15:01.866 - 00:15:04.300</b><br>you're continually only taking 30 percent<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.333 - 00:15:04.700</b><br>this can<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.700 - 00:15:07.766</b><br>go on and on and on and on and on for a very long time<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.400 - 00:15:11.733</b><br>20 profits from now you'll still be taking 30<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.733 - 00:15:13.966</b><br>percent and you'll have dwindled yourself down to<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.266 - 00:15:15.666</b><br>2 bitcoin but<br></p><p><b>00:15:15.733 - 00:15:17.566</b><br>your 2 Bitcoin will be worth so much money<br></p><p><b>00:15:17.566 - 00:15:18.400</b><br>and you'll still be taking<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.400 - 00:15:20.466</b><br>30 percent and it just keeps going and going<br></p><p><b>00:15:20.533 - 00:15:23.400</b><br>so you can see how this is an easier way to mentally<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.933 - 00:15:26.066</b><br>take your profits and feel good about<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.066 -

00:15:43.600</b><br>let's say you started with 50<br></p><p><b>00:15:44.100 - 00:15:48.500</b><br>and then you ended up selling that first what was at 15<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.566 - 00:15:49.366</b><br>bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:15:50.066 -
