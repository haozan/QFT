00:02:10.133</b><br>here's what my account was and here's what it's become<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.200 - 00:02:11.866</b><br>and all this kind of<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.866 - 00:02:13.933</b><br>positive feedback and I enjoy that<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.566 - 00:02:16.733</b><br>but I'm only one guy<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.200 - 00:02:19.566</b><br>and so as the community grows bigger and bigger and<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.566 - 00:02:22.266</b><br>bigger I can't answer everybody's questions<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.266 - 00:02:24.266</b><br>I can't give attention to each<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.266 - 00:02:25.333</b><br>individual person<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.566 - 00:02:27.366</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.500 - 00:02:30.133</b><br>out of a desire to be helpful<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.933 - 00:02:36.000</b><br>I've made these videos and kind of shared what I do<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.066 - 00:02:37.966</b><br>with everybody<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.766 - 00:02:41.500</b><br>and then once it gets out of control<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.066 - 00:02:44.000</b><br>I start feeling<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.066 - 00:02:46.766</b><br>bad because I can't answer everybody's questions<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.933 - 00:02:49.266</b><br>so there's four places that you can go<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.266 - 00:02:50.933</b><br>to discuss my methods<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.000 - 00:02:53.366</b><br>and ask questions and<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.533 - 00:02:56.133</b><br>either get answers from me or get answers from<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.366 - 00:02:57.266</b><br>our community<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.400 - 00:03:00.900</b><br>so obviously the very first place I would say would be<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.266 - 00:03:03.133</b><br>my blog which is<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.400 -

00:03:11.700</b><br>and lots of those have been with me for a long time<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.700 - 00:03:13.666</b><br>and they're able to answer a lot of the questions<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.666 - 00:03:14.966</b><br>the basic questions<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.466 - 00:03:16.533</b><br>so every time I post a video<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.533 - 00:03:18.666</b><br>you can just or in any of these other places<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.666 - 00:03:20.200</b><br>you can just go ahead and<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.600 - 00:03:23.600</b><br>ask your questions there and you know have discussions<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.600 - 00:03:25.300</b><br>but it's not as easy<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.500 - 00:03:28.133</b><br>to have discussions when you're posting on this type of<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.133 - 00:03:30.200</b><br>blog so because of that<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.166 - 00:03:33.100</b><br>members of our community have created other<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.100 - 00:03:34.200</b><br>avenues for us<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.200 -

00:03:51.000</b><br>broken on whatever coin it is<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.000 - 00:03:51.466</b><br>or<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.466 - 00:03:53.766</b><br>if you're just looking for account builder trades or<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.766 - 00:03:55.533</b><br>so forth<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.333 - 00:03:57.700</b><br>and so yeah<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.700 - 00:04:00.200</b><br>I mean this is very active and<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.366 - 00:04:04.600</b><br>you know it's got a community of 4,188 people<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.066 -

00:04:39.600</b><br>in keeping this website live<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.800 - 00:04:43.400</b><br>and he works on it his name is Tom and<br></p><p><b>00:04:45.000 - 00:04:45.933</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.466 -

00:05:26.200</b><br>then<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.200 - 00:05:27.700</b><br>you know just contribute a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.700 - 00:05:29.000</b><br>it doesn't cost a lot<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.133 -

00:05:53.333</b><br>and discord is<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.333 - 00:05:55.300</b><br>growing pretty fast you can see right now<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.300 - 00:05:58.266</b><br>it says that online there's 369 people<br></p><p><b>00:05:59.966 -

00:10:04.366</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:10:04.900 - 00:10:07.166</b><br>I see people getting into early on things<br></p><p><b>00:10:07.166 - 00:10:09.700</b><br>and you want an obvious panic<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.700 - 00:10:11.133</b><br>that's really what you're looking for<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.600 - 00:10:13.766</b><br>and I've said this a million times<br></p><p><b>00:10:14.700 - 00:10:15.800</b><br>so you know<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.166 -

00:10:23.666</b><br>bounce created a base right here<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.666 - 00:10:25.933</b><br>this is how we justify this base<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.966 - 00:10:29.866</b><br>so look at that massive circle that was there<br></p><p><b>00:10:29.866 - 00:10:30.666</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:10:30.733 - 00:10:33.733</b><br>and you can see this big beautiful bounce right here<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.733 - 00:10:34.933</b><br>created a base right there<br></p><p><b>00:10:34.933 - 00:10:36.133</b><br>and of course one right there also<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.133 - 00:10:40.533</b><br>but anyway and here's the circle you know so<br></p><p><b>00:10:40.933 - 00:10:42.100</b><br>quite a bit smaller<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.466 - 00:10:45.000</b><br>and then of course you got a base over here somewhere<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.400 - 00:10:47.266</b><br>I don't know where you're gonna draw your base but<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.533 - 00:10:48.566</b><br>what a big<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.766 - 00:10:51.766</b><br>long circle right so you're looking at these circles<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.866 - 00:10:54.000</b><br>and you're like you know circles can get pretty big<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.000 - 00:10:55.900</b><br>so if you're gonna call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.100 - 00:10:56.766</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.766 - 00:11:00.133</b><br>which is debatable because look at that bounce<br></p><p><b>00:11:00.200 - 00:11:02.066</b><br>and look at this bounce<br></p><p><b>00:11:02.066 - 00:11:03.766</b><br>and look at this bounce so<br></p><p><b>00:11:03.766 - 00:11:06.266</b><br>you know that's not much of a bounce right there<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.500 - 00:11:08.800</b><br>but if you were gonna call that a base which is fine<br></p><p><b>00:11:08.866 - 00:11:11.200</b><br>you know I still think that's that's pretty good<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.466 - 00:11:16.000</b><br>that's from 800 to 880 or 900 you know that's not bad<br></p><p><b>00:11:16.566 - 00:11:18.166</b><br>if you're going to call that a base<br></p><p><b>00:11:18.333 - 00:11:18.866</b><br>what kind of<br></p><p><b>00:11:18.866 - 00:11:21.166</b><br>circle are you looking for under that base<br></p><p><b>00:11:21.933 -

00:11:31.700</b><br>like look at where that red line is<br></p><p><b>00:11:32.300 - 00:11:33.100</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.266 - 00:11:34.866</b><br>where are you going to start nibbling<br></p><p><b>00:11:34.866 - 00:11:36.566</b><br>you know are you going to start nibbling right<br></p><p><b>00:11:36.566 - 00:11:38.600</b><br>here maybe and right here maybe<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.933 - 00:11:41.733</b><br>is this even very much of a circle<br></p><p><b>00:11:41.733 - 00:11:43.866</b><br>like could you maybe make your circle more<br></p><p><b>00:11:43.900 - 00:11:44.800</b><br>like that<br></p><p><b>00:11:45.700 - 00:11:46.866</b><br>so it's more realistic<br></p><p><b>00:11:46.866 - 00:11:48.900</b><br>like hey you know that's more of the middle<br></p><p><b>00:11:48.900 - 00:11:50.100</b><br>between those three anyway<br></p><p><b>00:11:50.100 - 00:11:52.566</b><br>what I'm saying is just don't get in early don't start<br></p><p><b>00:11:52.733 - 00:11:56.866</b><br>nibbling like right here when we just crack the base<br></p><p><b>00:11:58.733 - 00:11:59.800</b><br>and then of course<br></p><p><b>00:11:59.866 - 00:12:00.733</b><br>of course<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.733 -

00:13:36.700</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:13:36.766 - 00:13:37.366</b><br>maybe they were going<br></p><p><b>00:13:37.366 - 00:13:39.666</b><br>to put more regulations than Icos or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:13:40.166 - 00:13:42.566</b><br>and so that affects Neo and that affects Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:13:43.800 - 00:13:45.733</b><br>and we're getting a bit of a panic here<br></p><p><b>00:13:45.733 - 00:13:48.333</b><br>but is it going to get into a real good panic<br></p><p><b>00:13:48.333 - 00:13:51.166</b><br>are we going to start to get some nice long red bars<br></p><p><b>00:13:51.333 - 00:13:54.500</b><br>you know like look at these panics look how fast that<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.800 - 00:13:56.466</b><br>move that was and how long<br></p><p><b>00:13:56.466 - 00:13:58.300</b><br>those red bars were that are in here<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.666 - 00:13:58.866</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:13:58.866 - 00:14:01.300</b><br>and then obviously down here this big long one too<br></p><p><b>00:14:01.933 - 00:14:03.866</b><br>so anyway I don't know we're gonna see what happened<br></p><p><b>00:14:03.866 - 00:14:06.333</b><br>but obviously I didn't buy any yet I<br></p><p><b>00:14:07.266 - 00:14:08.933</b><br>you know if you're gonna play off this<br></p><p><b>00:14:09.166 - 00:14:11.066</b><br>could you call this a base right here<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.266 - 00:14:12.666</b><br>look at that bounce<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.000 - 00:14:15.600</b><br>you know that's from 95 all the way up to 145<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.600 - 00:14:17.800</b><br>so that's a much clearer balance<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.133 - 00:14:19.700</b><br>but I always say<br></p><p><b>00:14:20.266 - 00:14:22.666</b><br>the last base is the one that's most important<br></p><p><b>00:14:22.800 - 00:14:25.066</b><br>so I'm really working off of this one<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.166 - 00:14:26.666</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.666 - 00:14:29.600</b><br>eventually if this starts giving us some red long bars<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.066 - 00:14:31.500</b><br>you know I'm going to be jumping in there<br></p><p><b>00:14:32.000 - 00:14:34.133</b><br>and you know me I'm gonna be nibbling<br></p><p><b>00:14:34.133 - 00:14:36.666</b><br>just little nibbles and then eventually nice big<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.400 - 00:14:39.900</b><br>position sizes okay<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.366 - 00:14:42.500</b><br>so and then back to<br></p><p><b>00:14:42.966 - 00:14:45.066</b><br>theory to bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.733 - 00:14:47.600</b><br>bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:14:50.566 - 00:14:51.366</b><br>here<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.500 -

00:15:00.533</b><br>clear base right here<br></p><p><b>00:15:00.600 - 00:15:02.200</b><br>you know from 9<br></p><p><b>00:15:03.266 - 00:15:05.800</b><br>let's call it 90300 all the way up to 12<br></p><p><b>00:15:05.933 -

00:18:53.600</b><br>because you're looking at a chart<br></p><p><b>00:18:53.666 - 00:18:55.766</b><br>on coinage but<br></p><p><b>00:18:57.166 - 00:19:00.100</b><br>you can set alerts you can be like okay well<br></p><p><b>00:19:01.200 - 00:19:02.300</b><br>where's my alert<br></p><p><b>00:19:02.966 - 00:19:06.866</b><br>you can be like okay so just alert me when<br></p><p><b>00:19:06.900 - 00:19:09.933</b><br>72 gets hit you set your alert there<br></p><p><b>00:19:11.333 - 00:19:15.366</b><br>and then you write your order on the exchange<br></p><p><b>00:19:15.866 - 00:19:16.733</b><br>and when this<br></p><p><b>00:19:16.733 - 00:19:18.733</b><br>alert goes off you know you hit your order<br></p><p><b>00:19:19.366 - 00:19:20.300</b><br>and then okay<br></p><p><b>00:19:20.300 - 00:19:21.700</b><br>so then you set your sell up at<br></p><p><b>00:19:21.700 - 00:19:23.500</b><br>78 and you go and set your<br></p><p><b>00:19:23.600 - 00:19:25.466</b><br>the next alert right there at 78<br></p><p><b>00:19:25.466 - 00:19:26.266</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:19:26.566 - 00:19:29.666</b><br>so and then it's basically an extra step<br></p><p><b>00:19:30.166 - 00:19:31.566</b><br>but it's gonna keep you busy all day<br></p><p><b>00:19:31.566 - 00:19:33.333</b><br>and it's gonna keep you making money all day<br></p><p><b>00:19:34.533 - 00:19:36.533</b><br>and maybe the most important thing<br></p><p><b>00:19:37.200 - 00:19:38.000</b><br>is<br></p><p><b>00:19:39.000 - 00:19:41.100</b><br>it keeps you busy and preoccupied<br></p><p><b>00:19:41.100 - 00:19:43.200</b><br>so that you're not tempted to take a position<br></p><p><b>00:19:43.200 - 00:19:44.566</b><br>trade too early<br></p><p><b>00:19:44.900 - 00:19:46.300</b><br>so that you don't<br></p><p><b>00:19:46.566 - 00:19:49.200</b><br>look at this and be like oh we just cracked<br></p><p><b>00:19:49.200 - 00:19:51.366</b><br>and when you scroll in a little too close<br></p><p><b>00:19:51.733 - 00:19:53.000</b><br>and you're like aha<br></p><p><b>00:19:53.366 - 00:19:56.666</b><br>you know I'm gonna start getting in here at 89's<br></p><p><b>00:19:56.966 - 00:19:59.400</b><br>well your circle should really be<br></p><p><b>00:20:01.966 - 00:20:03.000</b><br>my undraw<br></p><p><b>00:20:03.300 - 00:20:06.066</b><br>your circle is probably something that looks more like<br></p><p><b>00:20:06.066 - 00:20:06.600</b><br>this<br></p><p><b>00:20:06.600 - 00:20:07.466</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:20:07.566 - 00:20:09.366</b><br>I haven't gone back in the past to check all the<br></p><p><b>00:20:09.366 - 00:20:10.200</b><br>circles but look<br></p><p><b>00:20:10.200 - 00:20:12.066</b><br>here look let's look at this circle<br></p><p><b>00:20:12.900 - 00:20:14.366</b><br>this circle was that big<br></p><p><b>00:20:14.600 - 00:20:16.600</b><br>so your circle has to be at least that big<br></p><p><b>00:20:17.100 - 00:20:19.133</b><br>right because this I'm sure this was a small one<br></p><p><b>00:20:19.500 - 00:20:20.200</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:20:20.200 - 00:20:23.133</b><br>if your circle is that big let's draw this out properly<br></p><p><b>00:20:23.933 - 00:20:24.900</b><br>you know it might<br></p><p><b>00:20:24.900 - 00:20:26.666</b><br>your circle might look something like that<br></p><p><b>00:20:27.100 - 00:20:29.300</b><br>and so that means the bottom of your circle is like<br></p><p><b>00:20:29.300 - 00:20:30.300</b><br></p><p><b>00:20:31.266 - 00:20:34.133</b><br>so you don't want to be getting in an 8800 right<br></p><p><b>00:20:34.133 - 00:20:35.566</b><br>right past the crack<br></p><p><b>00:20:35.700 - 00:20:36.933</b><br>you want to wait for<br></p><p><b>00:20:36.933 - 00:20:37.200</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:20:37.200 - 00:20:39.700</b><br>like half the circle maybe and start nibbling here<br></p><p><b>00:20:40.000 - 00:20:43.600</b><br>start nibbling around 8,000 or 7 800 or something<br></p><p><b>00:20:43.666 - 00:20:44.466</b><br>nibble there<br></p><p><b>00:20:44.733 - 00:20:46.100</b><br>nibble there nibble there<br></p><p><b>00:20:46.900 - 00:20:50.166</b><br>well and get size here and start to get real big sizer<br></p><p><b>00:20:51.266 - 00:20:53.000</b><br>anyway you get by point<br></p><p><b>00:20:53.000 - 00:20:54.266</b><br>keep yourself busy<br></p><p><b>00:20:54.500 - 00:20:56.933</b><br>with the small account trades if you can't<br></p><p><b>00:20:57.766 - 00:20:59.566</b><br>control your need<br></p><p><b>00:20:59.900 - 00:21:00.933</b><br>to jump in early<br></p></body></html>
