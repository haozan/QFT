00:00:08.566</b><br>and in that video we discussed some of my past<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.266 - 00:00:10.666</b><br>edges that I found in the market<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.000 - 00:00:13.266</b><br>and this is just a few of them<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.266 - 00:00:15.400</b><br>that I found in the past that we discussed<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.566 - 00:00:16.866</b><br>I've got a whole list of them<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.200 - 00:00:19.933</b><br>but we just want to make a huge long video and<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.933 - 00:00:22.366</b><br>keep going over more of these edges<br></p><p><b>00:00:22.366 - 00:00:23.366</b><br>but you can tell<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.500 - 00:00:25.400</b><br>just from the examples that I have here<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.733 - 00:00:28.566</b><br>that most of the edges in the past<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.700 - 00:00:29.500</b><br>have been<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.366 - 00:00:31.566</b><br>because of technology<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.133 - 00:00:35.300</b><br>sometimes it can be just as simple as just a feature<br></p><p><b>00:00:35.300 - 00:00:36.500</b><br>that a broker has<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.900 - 00:00:38.400</b><br>that all the other brokers don't have<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.566 - 00:00:40.166</b><br>that gives you such a massive<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.166 - 00:00:41.700</b><br>edge over the rest of the market<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.266 - 00:00:44.533</b><br>like that whole middle price<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.066 - 00:00:47.333</b><br>you know when one of the brokers I had was<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.333 - 00:00:48.600</b><br>actually a market maker<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.666 - 00:00:50.466</b><br>and so they were giving me the middle price<br></p><p><b>00:00:50.466 - 00:00:52.966</b><br>that was a huge advantage over the market<br></p><p><b>00:00:53.466 - 00:00:56.166</b><br>if you happen to have one of those brokers<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.166 - 00:00:58.133</b><br>that had a good shortlist<br></p><p><b>00:00:58.333 - 00:01:00.800</b><br>back before everybody else was shorting<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.333 - 00:01:02.366</b><br>NASDAQ stocks<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.366 - 00:01:04.100</b><br>that would have given you like a huge<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.100 - 00:01:05.400</b><br>edge over the market<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.100 - 00:01:06.866</b><br>to be honest with you<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.866 - 00:01:08.933</b><br>I love when you have a piece<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.933 - 00:01:10.700</b><br>of technology that gives you the edge<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.700 - 00:01:12.266</b><br>I love that type of edge<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.333 - 00:01:15.800</b><br>because if you try to develop a trading plan<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.266 - 00:01:19.133</b><br>where you're following some indicators<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.133 - 00:01:20.200</b><br>or something like that<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.766 - 00:01:22.933</b><br>you really don't have an edge like<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.300 - 00:01:25.566</b><br>you have a maybe statistical edge<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.566 - 00:01:28.800</b><br>like maybe you can say you know out of 10 trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.900 - 00:01:30.800</b><br>six of them will be winners or<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.800 - 00:01:33.333</b><br>my winners will be bigger than my losers<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.333 - 00:01:35.066</b><br>and therefore I can lose<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.066 - 00:01:38.366</b><br>two times more than I can win and I can still win<br></p><p><b>00:01:38.366 - 00:01:41.666</b><br>overall you can come up with a mathematical edge or a<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.666 - 00:01:43.933</b><br>systematic edge or you can<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.000 - 00:01:45.666</b><br>come up with a<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.000 - 00:01:48.900</b><br>look at a chart and read the technicals and say<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.166 - 00:01:50.266</b><br>you know if<br></p><p><b>00:01:50.866 - 00:01:51.666</b><br>this<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.800 - 00:01:54.166</b><br>pattern shows up<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.300 - 00:01:57.933</b><br>and it falls in line with this you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.200 - 00:02:01.300</b><br>moving average and it falls in line with the RSI<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.466 - 00:02:03.333</b><br>there's enough things that line up<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.566 - 00:02:05.533</b><br>then that means that enough people<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.533 - 00:02:08.000</b><br>the RSI traders will be on this<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.100 - 00:02:08.933</b><br>and the<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.500 - 00:02:11.566</b><br>moving average traders will be on this<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.566 - 00:02:12.466</b><br>and the<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.100 - 00:02:13.900</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.933 - 00:02:17.133</b><br>double bottom traders will be on this and all these<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.300 - 00:02:18.900</b><br>if enough people are on this<br></p><p><b>00:02:18.900 - 00:02:20.900</b><br>it gives you a higher probability of this<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.900 - 00:02:21.866</b><br>being successful<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.266 - 00:02:25.966</b><br>I don't really like those trades very much because<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.266 - 00:02:27.933</b><br>while there is a small edge<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.933 - 00:02:30.466</b><br>it's not much of an edge because everybody has that<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.800 - 00:02:33.566</b><br>but if you hit on a piece of technology<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.800 - 00:02:37.200</b><br>that nobody else has that gives you an edge<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.300 - 00:02:38.966</b><br>it's just<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.966 - 00:02:41.266</b><br>it's like you're the only one with this<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.266 - 00:02:42.766</b><br>and nobody else has it<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.766 - 00:02:44.366</b><br>and it's just massive<br></p><p><b>00:02:44.366 - 00:02:47.500</b><br>it's like shooting fish in a barrel every day<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.800 - 00:02:49.200</b><br>until that edge stops<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.400 - 00:02:54.466</b><br>since technology is my favorite kind of edge<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.600 - 00:02:56.800</b><br>I have a budget that I put aside every month<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.966 - 00:02:58.466</b><br>and try to<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.000 - 00:03:00.100</b><br>continually<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.200 - 00:03:03.533</b><br>try every piece of new software that comes out<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.800 - 00:03:05.266</b><br>I'm always<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.600 - 00:03:08.533</b><br>opening up accounts with new brokers<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.566 - 00:03:12.000</b><br>I'm looking for new charting platforms all the time<br></p><p><b>00:03:12.066 - 00:03:14.600</b><br>every week and that's really why<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.566 - 00:03:18.466</b><br>the group of guys and me we start building that tool<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.900 - 00:03:20.200</b><br>for cryptocurrencies<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.133 - 00:03:23.133</b><br>because I mean if you can't find the<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.133 - 00:03:25.766</b><br>edge sometimes it's just better to try to build it<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.400 - 00:03:27.866</b><br>anyway for the stock market<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.566 - 00:03:30.100</b><br>I discovered a long time ago<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.500 - 00:03:34.066</b><br>that if you put some money aside if you just<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.066 - 00:03:35.133</b><br>make that part of your budget<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.133 - 00:03:36.200</b><br>and you put some money aside<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.200 - 00:03:37.100</b><br>and you just keep on<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.100 - 00:03:38.000</b><br>trying new things<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.000 - 00:03:38.733</b><br>trying new things<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.733 - 00:03:39.600</b><br>trying new things<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.866 - 00:03:42.900</b><br>that's how I found all those other edges in the past<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.700 - 00:03:46.466</b><br>that's really the secret way it's like<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.866 - 00:03:48.300</b><br>if you don't have a job<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.900 - 00:03:51.366</b><br>then make a job out of looking for a job<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.366 - 00:03:53.733</b><br>like wake up every morning at 9 o'clock<br></p><p><b>00:03:54.066 - 00:03:55.533</b><br>get dressed up in a suit and<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.533 - 00:03:57.000</b><br>tie or whatever it is you want<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.266 - 00:03:59.500</b><br>go out there and start putting out your application<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.500 - 00:04:01.766</b><br>everywhere and try to line up some interviews<br></p><p><b>00:04:01.766 - 00:04:03.600</b><br>and even if you're not<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.200 - 00:04:05.000</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.133 - 00:04:08.366</b><br>qualified for the job that you're looking for<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.700 - 00:04:10.933</b><br>if you just keep on trying and keep on trying and keep<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.933 - 00:04:13.066</b><br>on trying and you just do it Monday to Friday<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.066 - 00:04:14.533</b><br>you're gonna get a job<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.700 - 00:04:15.300</b><br>eventually<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.300 - 00:04:17.000</b><br>somebody's gonna give you a shot<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.133 - 00:04:18.400</b><br>and you're gonna get a job<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.700 - 00:04:19.933</b><br>so I mean<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.100 - 00:04:23.166</b><br>that way in that respect if you look at it that way<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.733 - 00:04:25.866</b><br>you're basically guaranteed<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.466 - 00:04:27.900</b><br>you're going to get a job<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.966 - 00:04:31.000</b><br>if you have this little formula of<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.166 - 00:04:34.566</b><br>every day I'm going to look for a job until I get one<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.866 - 00:04:36.533</b><br>you will eventually get one<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.533 - 00:04:37.766</b><br>it's just going to happen<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.200 - 00:04:41.066</b><br>the same thing with this if you don't have an edge<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.300 - 00:04:43.933</b><br>but you just continually look for an edge<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.000 - 00:04:46.900</b><br>and try out every new piece of software that comes out<br></p><p><b>00:04:47.166 - 00:04:49.066</b><br>you eventually will have an edge<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.066 - 00:04:50.333</b><br>like it's going to happen<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.533 - 00:04:51.333</b><br>so that's why<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.333 - 00:04:53.966</b><br>rather than wait for my edge to stop working<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.100 - 00:04:57.933</b><br>while I have one and I'm making good money on it<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.066 - 00:04:59.600</b><br>I take a piece of that money<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.600 - 00:05:01.300</b><br>I take a little bit of my budget<br></p><p><b>00:05:01.300 - 00:05:03.933</b><br>and I put it towards trying new things<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.933 - 00:05:05.266</b><br>every single week<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.366 - 00:05:06.566</b><br>day in day out<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.066 - 00:05:07.866</b><br>until<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.333 - 00:05:09.200</b><br>tag on an edge<br></p><p><b>00:05:09.200 - 00:05:12.500</b><br>so let's go through a list of what exactly I do<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.500 - 00:05:14.000</b><br>while I'm looking for an edge<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.133 - 00:05:16.100</b><br>so starting off with chat rooms<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.100 - 00:05:17.400</b><br>now I subscribe<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.966 -

00:09:00.533</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.600 - 00:09:03.966</b><br>because he's chasing all these runners that often<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.133 - 00:09:05.500</b><br>take a bad turn<br></p><p><b>00:09:06.500 -

00:14:35.366</b><br>and basically<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.466 - 00:14:38.900</b><br>you scroll yourself back down to the start of the day<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.933 - 00:14:40.333</b><br>before the move happened<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.500 -

00:15:06.300</b><br>and go through his<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.900 - 00:15:09.333</b><br>posts and see if he's<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.333 - 00:15:10.500</b><br>often<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.333 - 00:15:11.866</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.866 - 00:15:14.600</b><br>now you're leading down a path of finding a guy<br></p><p><b>00:15:14.600 - 00:15:15.800</b><br>who knows what he's doing<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.566 - 00:15:18.000</b><br>and so I do that<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.000 -

00:15:26.600</b><br>then you can kind of<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.600 - 00:15:28.733</b><br>try to figure out what it is that they're doing<br></p><p><b>00:15:28.866 - 00:15:30.733</b><br>it might fall in line with the type of<br></p><p><b>00:15:30.733 - 00:15:31.900</b><br>trading that you're doing<br></p><p><b>00:15:31.900 - 00:15:32.800</b><br>it might not<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.500 - 00:15:35.966</b><br>but it's something that you can do in the evenings<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.966 -
