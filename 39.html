00:00:18.500</b><br>actually that's pretty good<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.000 - 00:00:20.766</b><br>but yeah it is slow like pretty dead<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.766 - 00:00:22.166</b><br>I'm not seeing very much action<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.100 - 00:00:24.966</b><br>sorry this is my penny stock screen<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.400 - 00:00:26.566</b><br>here let me switch it<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.300 - 00:00:29.700</b><br>in an effort to make short videos for you guys<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.000 - 00:00:32.100</b><br>during my trading day while I'm trading<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.133 - 00:00:34.166</b><br>any time that there's like a slow time like this<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.166 - 00:00:37.566</b><br>I'll try to answer a few questions and<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.866 - 00:00:40.000</b><br>just make a real short video for everybody<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.466 - 00:00:41.566</b><br>one of the questions I've been getting<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.566 - 00:00:42.800</b><br>lately is about level 2<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.900 - 00:00:47.266</b><br>some people don't know what level 2 is and you know<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.300 - 00:00:48.666</b><br>I'm referring to the book<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.666 - 00:00:50.733</b><br>right I'm not referring to market depth<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.000 - 00:00:52.066</b><br>I'm referring to the book<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.066 - 00:00:54.866</b><br>so this is the book great here this is level 2<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.866 - 00:00:59.533</b><br>level 1 is your very top ask and your very top<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.400 - 00:01:03.266</b><br>bit so the closest bit and the closest ask<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.266 - 00:01:04.400</b><br>is called level 1<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.733 - 00:01:07.933</b><br>so level 2 is the whole book all the orders<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.466 - 00:01:09.266</b><br>in the book<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.366 - 00:01:13.800</b><br>this is a good example of a thin book so<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.466 - 00:01:18.500</b><br>you see yesterday on this coin can ether on COO coin<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.766 - 00:01:22.400</b><br>yesterday we had this massive spike all the way up to<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.400 - 00:01:25.366</b><br>84 and then a reaction cell<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.700 - 00:01:29.133</b><br>cause the massive spike back down to 43<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.266 - 00:01:31.933</b><br>so you know there's 100% trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.066 - 00:01:34.333</b><br>how would you ever<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.333 - 00:01:38.200</b><br>sell on this spike and how would you ever buy on this<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.566 - 00:01:42.366</b><br>dip<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.166 - 00:01:45.500</b><br>so what creates these massive splakes and what<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.500 - 00:01:46.666</b><br>creates these drops<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.666 - 00:01:49.133</b><br>or sometimes we call them fat finger drops<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.366 - 00:01:50.533</b><br>what creates those things<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.266 - 00:01:52.600</b><br>the answer is a thin book<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.900 - 00:01:55.533</b><br>so if somebody decided they wanted to chunk of this<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.766 - 00:01:57.866</b><br>they'd have to eat through all of this book<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.100 - 00:02:01.300</b><br>like if they decided they wanted 100,000 coins<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.500 - 00:02:03.533</b><br>they're going to eat this 49 guy and this<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.100 - 00:02:08.566</b><br>172 guy and then up here 117 guy and then 4840<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.066 - 00:02:12.000</b><br>guy and they just have to eat the whole book<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.000 - 00:02:13.733</b><br>to be able to fulfill that order<br></p><p><b>00:02:13.800 - 00:02:16.133</b><br>or they mistyped an order<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.300 - 00:02:18.800</b><br>so they decided to buy maybe they decided to buy<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.366 - 00:02:23.366</b><br>00052 and instead they type point 0052<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.200 - 00:02:26.366</b><br>which means that whatever order they made<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.700 - 00:02:29.100</b><br>just ate through all the book up to<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.533 - 00:02:30.733</b><br>where they run out of<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.733 - 00:02:32.166</b><br>how many coins they put in the heart<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.900 - 00:02:34.866</b><br>so with these small account building trades<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.866 - 00:02:37.166</b><br>what you really have to do is trade the chart<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.066 - 00:02:40.966</b><br>so a thin book is actually an advantage and<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.100 - 00:02:43.300</b><br>I know at first it doesn't seem like it would be<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.466 - 00:02:45.733</b><br>because how do you stick an order on here that's of<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.733 - 00:02:47.333</b><br>any decent size<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.333 - 00:02:48.533</b><br>if you want to buy<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.533 - 00:02:51.100</b><br>10,000 coins of this<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.733 - 00:02:54.566</b><br>if you go and try to stick your order 10 000 year at<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.566 - 00:02:56.133</b><br>point 0052<br></p><p><b>00:02:56.400 - 00:02:57.900</b><br>if that's where you'd like to get it<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.933 - 00:02:59.966</b><br>everybody's gonna go and<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.966 - 00:03:02.666</b><br>put all these little baby orders in front of you right<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.933 - 00:03:04.333</b><br>so you have to<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.366 - 00:03:07.600</b><br>layer your order in and that also allows you<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.766 - 00:03:10.966</b><br>to go ahead and take advantage of these massive spikes<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.966 - 00:03:13.166</b><br>when somebody does make a mistake<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.166 - 00:03:15.500</b><br>or somebody does want to buy a whole bunch of it<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.800 - 00:03:17.066</b><br>so you have<br></p><p><b>00:03:17.200 - 00:03:19.466</b><br>really really great percentages<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.466 - 00:03:20.200</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.200 - 00:03:22.666</b><br>and you want to<br></p><p><b>00:03:22.666 - 00:03:23.700</b><br>like imagine if you<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.700 - 00:03:26.400</b><br>had gotten some of these 44s or 46s<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.533 - 00:03:29.266</b><br>well within a few seconds they're worth 60s<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.533 - 00:03:32.933</b><br>you know so you'll go ahead and make that 30 40 percent<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.000 - 00:03:34.733</b><br>you have to be really quick at layering<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.733 - 00:03:37.866</b><br>so the minute you hear that you got some at 46<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.866 - 00:03:38.966</b><br>44 whatever<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.133 - 00:03:41.666</b><br>you have to right away start sticking your layers in<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.700 - 00:03:44.500</b><br>and the way I layer I try to<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.166 - 00:03:46.733</b><br>put different amounts<br></p><p><b>00:03:47.066 - 00:03:51.100</b><br>per layer so like if I put you know 500 over here<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.266 - 00:03:53.300</b><br>then I'll put 650 over here<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.300 - 00:03:55.133</b><br>then I'll put 850 over there<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.300 - 00:03:56.100</b><br>then I'll put<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.200 - 00:04:00.133</b><br>you know 1,110 here and so on so forth I just<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.300 - 00:04:01.100</b><br>always<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.300 - 00:04:03.100</b><br>oh man<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.200 - 00:04:05.333</b><br>so I'm not only changing the amounts<br></p><p><b>00:04:05.600 - 00:04:07.400</b><br>but I'm also changing the size right<br></p><p><b>00:04:07.400 - 00:04:09.066</b><br>so the further out from the mean<br></p><p><b>00:04:09.066 - 00:04:10.600</b><br>the bigger the size gets<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.700 - 00:04:12.166</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.366 - 00:04:14.800</b><br>that what you're really trying to accomplish<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.800 - 00:04:15.866</b><br>with layering<br></p><p><b>00:04:15.966 - 00:04:16.766</b><br>is<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.000 - 00:04:17.800</b><br>you want<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.933 - 00:04:20.566</b><br>the further out of gets for your orders to be bigger<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.566 - 00:04:22.866</b><br>so that your average is really good on<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.000 - 00:04:25.333</b><br>these drops and on these<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.566 - 00:04:26.333</b><br>spikes<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.333 - 00:04:29.166</b><br>but also you want to hide in the book<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.200 - 00:04:29.900</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.900 - 00:04:31.000</b><br>so you want<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.166 - 00:04:34.566</b><br>you want your orders not to look like they're all you<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.566 - 00:04:37.600</b><br>if you go and put a 5000 order and a 5000 order and a<br></p><p><b>00:04:37.600 - 00:04:40.566</b><br>5000 everybody's gonna figure out you real quick<br></p><p><b>00:04:40.566 - 00:04:42.100</b><br>after a few days of this<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.166 - 00:04:44.600</b><br>they're gonna realize that this is one guy<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.600 - 00:04:46.733</b><br>that keeps on putting these fives and<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.766 - 00:04:48.466</b><br>they're gonna try to get in front of you and<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.566 - 00:04:50.666</b><br>mess with you a little bit but if<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.966 - 00:04:53.600</b><br>you have all different numbers and you just blend in<br></p><p><b>00:04:53.966 - 00:04:55.500</b><br>then they just have no clue<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.500 - 00:04:57.966</b><br>and you're trying not to change this chart<br></p><p><b>00:04:57.966 - 00:04:58.533</b><br>you're trying to<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.533 - 00:05:00.800</b><br>allow this chart to continue doing what it's doing<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.866 - 00:05:02.533</b><br>so you just want to blend in<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.600 - 00:05:03.066</b><br>you want to<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.066 - 00:05:05.866</b><br>size in kind of like the sizes you're seeing<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.100 - 00:05:08.566</b><br>and you want your numbers to be all different<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.866 - 00:05:11.400</b><br>like this guy right here with 48 40<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.733 - 00:05:12.533</b><br>I mean<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.566 - 00:05:14.366</b><br>that sounds like that's all he has<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.866 - 00:05:15.666</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.666 - 00:05:17.766</b><br>now another common question<br></p><p><b>00:05:17.766 - 00:05:19.266</b><br>that everybody is asking is where do you<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.266 - 00:05:20.466</b><br>find these charts<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.466 - 00:05:23.166</b><br>like where do you get charts that are constantly whippy<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.166 - 00:05:25.666</b><br>back and forth and this is not the ideal chart I mean<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.733 - 00:05:28.700</b><br>that was a 100 percent move right there<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.766 - 00:05:30.366</b><br>but it's not always a 100 percent move<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.366 - 00:05:32.266</b><br>it looks like you're getting you know a 10<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.266 - 00:05:34.333</b><br>or 15 percent move back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.800 - 00:05:37.533</b><br>but what you're looking for in chart in these charts<br></p><p><b>00:05:37.666 - 00:05:40.100</b><br>No. 1 is you want daily movement<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.100 - 00:05:41.133</b><br>you want to see<br></p><p><b>00:05:41.300 - 00:05:43.166</b><br>that there's back and forth back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.166 - 00:05:44.133</b><br>that there's action<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.200 - 00:05:45.800</b><br>that people are interested<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.800 - 00:05:47.500</b><br>that this thing constantly moves<br></p><p><b>00:05:47.500 - 00:05:49.666</b><br>that way you're not gonna be stuck just waiting there<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.933 - 00:05:52.566</b><br>and then you want some size<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.566 - 00:05:54.666</b><br>you like you don't want big size<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.666 - 00:05:55.466</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:05:55.566 - 00:05:57.866</b><br>big size won't give you whippy charts usually<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.166 - 00:05:58.800</b><br>but you want<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.800 - 00:06:00.700</b><br>at least some size so you can make something<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.700 - 00:06:03.000</b><br>so you want to be able to put $200 in<br></p><p><b>00:06:03.066 - 00:06:04.933</b><br>and make 80 dollars or something<br></p><p><b>00:06:05.533 -

00:07:13.133</b><br>in our Slack room<br></p><p><b>00:07:13.966 - 00:07:14.933</b><br>let me try for free<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.400 - 00:07:17.700</b><br>and actually he still hasn't ever charged me<br></p><p><b>00:07:17.700 - 00:07:18.900</b><br>which is fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:07:18.900 - 00:07:20.800</b><br>I don't use it that much<br></p><p><b>00:07:20.800 - 00:07:22.600</b><br>but lately I've been using it a lot more<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.600 - 00:07:23.800</b><br>especially since<br></p><p><b>00:07:23.900 - 00:07:26.000</b><br>he developed the fat finger<br></p><p><b>00:07:26.166 - 00:07:27.533</b><br>scanner which is<br></p><p><b>00:07:27.733 -

00:07:38.900</b><br>extend your subscription<br></p><p><b>00:07:39.900 - 00:07:41.166</b><br>you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:07:42.466 - 00:07:43.700</b><br>you can get it down<br></p><p><b>00:07:43.733 - 00:07:47.400</b><br>to 1596 euros so that's like 18 bucks a month<br></p><p><b>00:07:47.400 - 00:07:49.300</b><br>you can get it down to 18 bucks a month<br></p><p><b>00:07:49.366 - 00:07:51.400</b><br>or you can pay I think at<br></p><p><b>00:07:51.666 - 00:07:53.366</b><br>you know if you just want to try it for a month<br></p><p><b>00:07:53.600 - 00:07:54.466</b><br>you're paying like<br></p><p><b>00:07:54.566 - 00:07:57.200</b><br>I don't know 30 bucks or 28 bucks or something<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.300 -

00:08:07.000</b><br>of course<br></p><p><b>00:08:07.000 - 00:08:08.300</b><br>you guys won't get that in the video<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.300 - 00:08:09.166</b><br>because I just paused<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.933 - 00:08:10.733</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.066 - 00:08:12.933</b><br>it's up to you whether or not you want to pay<br></p><p><b>00:08:12.933 - 00:08:14.000</b><br>for a market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:08:14.000 - 00:08:16.066</b><br>we have other market scanners that we use<br></p><p><b>00:08:16.166 - 00:08:16.966</b><br>that are free<br></p><p><b>00:08:17.000 - 00:08:18.900</b><br>but he has put a lot of work into this<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.133 - 00:08:20.466</b><br>I don't get anything<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.900 - 00:08:23.133</b><br>I don't get any money for you guys subscribing<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.133 - 00:08:25.533</b><br>I don't have a referral code nothing like that<br></p><p><b>00:08:27.200 - 00:08:28.933</b><br>he has allowed me to use it for free<br></p><p><b>00:08:28.933 - 00:08:30.600</b><br>so I guess I get that benefit<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.766 - 00:08:32.933</b><br>so it's up to you whether or not you want to<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.000 - 00:08:34.066</b><br>pay for a scanner<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.066 - 00:08:36.666</b><br>but it is getting pretty good I have to admit<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.400 - 00:08:39.000</b><br>so if we go to quickscan<br></p><p><b>00:08:40.066 - 00:08:42.266</b><br>actually let's go to Base Scanner first<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.366 - 00:08:45.600</b><br>so over here in Base Scanner<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.466 - 00:08:48.366</b><br>now this the whole reason<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.366 - 00:08:48.966</b><br>we brought this up<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.966 - 00:08:50.900</b><br>was because you're looking for account building traits<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.900 - 00:08:52.900</b><br>and you're looking for those fat finger traits<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.766 - 00:08:56.333</b><br>when it comes to the position traits<br></p><p><b>00:08:56.400 - 00:08:59.466</b><br>they're pretty basic really just on Kenigi<br></p><p><b>00:08:59.800 - 00:09:00.566</b><br>coinage<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.566 - 00:09:01.333</b><br>you can go<br></p><p><b>00:09:01.333 - 00:09:03.966</b><br>and draw your bases and draw your safe circles<br></p><p><b>00:09:04.066 - 00:09:05.333</b><br>and you can set up your alerts<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.333 - 00:09:07.400</b><br>and you don't really need an app like this<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.566 - 00:09:10.533</b><br>but to find all the count builder trays this does help<br></p><p><b>00:09:10.566 - 00:09:12.000</b><br>you know like for instance right here<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.000 - 00:09:15.200</b><br>it's saying that there was a drop of 16 percent<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.333 - 00:09:18.400</b><br>below the base on this coin<br></p><p><b>00:09:19.000 - 00:09:19.800</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.200 - 00:09:23.400</b><br>I wouldn't be really<br></p><p><b>00:09:23.566 - 00:09:25.166</b><br>caring too much about bases<br></p><p><b>00:09:25.166 - 00:09:26.500</b><br>when you are looking at a coin like this<br></p><p><b>00:09:26.500 - 00:09:29.766</b><br>especially if you are looking for things that are<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.266 - 00:09:31.733</b><br>going to be account builders and you want<br></p><p><b>00:09:31.966 - 00:09:33.666</b><br>a chart that's whippy back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.666 - 00:09:34.866</b><br>whip you back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.933 - 00:09:37.366</b><br>then bases don't really count for much because you're<br></p><p><b>00:09:37.366 - 00:09:39.200</b><br>really trading within ranges<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.733 - 00:09:42.900</b><br>so if you're using this app to try to find<br></p><p><b>00:09:43.100 - 00:09:44.733</b><br>account building trades<br></p><p><b>00:09:45.733 - 00:09:46.600</b><br>you're gonna find<br></p><p><b>00:09:46.600 - 00:09:49.266</b><br>anything that drops significantly below<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.400 - 00:09:50.200</b><br>a low<br></p><p><b>00:09:50.266 - 00:09:53.600</b><br>right so just imagine this is saying it's dropping 16<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.800 - 00:09:55.000</b><br>percent below<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.400 - 00:09:59.133</b><br>this last you know low end of this range<br></p><p><b>00:09:59.333 - 00:10:02.600</b><br>so if this range was from $5 to<br></p><p><b>00:10:04.400 - 00:10:05.566</b><br>11 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:10:05.666 - 00:10:08.166</b><br>and it's been bouncing back and forth you know<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.166 - 00:10:09.933</b><br>between 650 and 8<br></p><p><b>00:10:10.100 - 00:10:11.666</b><br>and then got down here<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.000 - 00:10:12.466</b><br>to<br></p><p><b>00:10:12.466 - 00:10:13.933</b><br>6 dollars and then<br></p><p><b>00:10:14.066 - 00:10:15.400</b><br>ended up going all the way up to 10<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.400 - 00:10:16.766</b><br>and then eventually came back down to<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.766 - 00:10:19.133</b><br>6 dollars and then went all the way up to almost 8<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.333 - 00:10:21.733</b><br>and then back down to $6 and then finally<br></p><p><b>00:10:21.733 - 00:10:23.266</b><br>crack that $6<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.966 - 00:10:24.566</b><br>then it's kind of<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.566 - 00:10:26.533</b><br>giving you an indication of how far it cracked<br></p><p><b>00:10:26.533 - 00:10:27.333</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.733 - 00:10:29.866</b><br>you can see that this is something that you could work<br></p><p><b>00:10:29.966 - 00:10:33.133</b><br>and there'll be much nicer charts than this<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.666 - 00:10:36.933</b><br>this is just the one that is currently there when I'm<br></p><p><b>00:10:37.200 - 00:10:38.566</b><br>showing you this thing so<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.466 - 00:10:40.933</b><br>by no means don't call this<br></p><p><b>00:10:41.100 - 00:10:42.500</b><br>small account builder and this is<br></p><p><b>00:10:42.500 - 00:10:43.600</b><br>perfect chart and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.600 - 00:10:44.600</b><br>but it's not bad<br></p><p><b>00:10:44.600 - 00:10:46.200</b><br>I would consider working this<br></p><p><b>00:10:46.200 - 00:10:48.800</b><br>especially if after looking at level 2<br></p><p><b>00:10:49.600 - 00:10:52.366</b><br>I can see just how much size is going in and out<br></p><p><b>00:10:53.166 - 00:10:54.466</b><br>so this is very decent<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.500 - 00:10:56.800</b><br>for looking for those account building treats<br></p><p><b>00:10:56.800 - 00:10:59.100</b><br>and you can pick your markets over here<br></p><p><b>00:11:00.000 - 00:11:01.766</b><br>I just have Bittrax in Hitbit<br></p><p><b>00:11:01.766 - 00:11:04.066</b><br>but you can pick your markets of whatever it is that<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.066 - 00:11:05.000</b><br>you're interested in<br></p><p><b>00:11:05.100 - 00:11:06.333</b><br>and here's the<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.333 - 00:11:07.133</b><br>here's the kicker<br></p><p><b>00:11:07.133 - 00:11:08.966</b><br>here's the thing that everybody's been waiting for<br></p><p><b>00:11:08.966 - 00:11:10.166</b><br>the quick scan<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.533 - 00:11:12.100</b><br>fat finger percentage<br></p><p><b>00:11:12.500 - 00:11:14.066</b><br>that fat finger<br></p><p><b>00:11:16.100 - 00:11:19.100</b><br>scanner is what everybody's been asking for and he<br></p><p><b>00:11:19.133 - 00:11:21.533</b><br>got ahead of the game and went and made one<br></p><p><b>00:11:21.866 - 00:11:24.733</b><br>so over here if you go to edit filters<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.933 - 00:11:26.133</b><br>you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.166 - 00:11:29.333</b><br>because I'm just trying to get notifications<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.333 - 00:11:30.866</b><br>like I don't have time to be<br></p><p><b>00:11:30.900 - 00:11:32.766</b><br>looking at all the charts I don't have time<br></p><p><b>00:11:32.933 - 00:11:33.733</b><br>to be<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.933 - 00:11:37.400</b><br>dealing with coins when I'm working in penny stocks<br></p><p><b>00:11:37.400 - 00:11:40.166</b><br>so I just want to hear an audible sound<br></p><p><b>00:11:40.500 - 00:11:41.766</b><br>and this is the sound<br></p><p><b>00:11:43.900 - 00:11:45.533</b><br>so I just want to hear that sound<br></p><p><b>00:11:45.733 - 00:11:48.466</b><br>when there's a fat finger trade<br></p><p><b>00:11:48.466 - 00:11:51.800</b><br>and basically what a fat finger trade is<br></p><p><b>00:11:52.900 - 00:11:54.933</b><br>okay so let's go back to the chart for a second<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.933 - 00:11:57.766</b><br>and just talk about what a real fat finger trade is<br></p><p><b>00:11:58.066 - 00:12:00.266</b><br>and what you want a scanner to find<br></p><p><b>00:12:00.300 - 00:12:02.566</b><br>and that's basically how he wrote a scanner<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.700 - 00:12:03.933</b><br>so in this case<br></p><p><b>00:12:03.933 - 00:12:05.466</b><br>I'm not saying this was a fat finger<br></p><p><b>00:12:05.466 - 00:12:07.733</b><br>trade because you had this massive spike<br></p><p><b>00:12:07.733 - 00:12:08.933</b><br>and then you had a reaction<br></p><p><b>00:12:08.933 - 00:12:10.766</b><br>cell and it just overextended<br></p><p><b>00:12:10.866 - 00:12:12.700</b><br>so that's not necessarily a fat finger track<br></p><p><b>00:12:12.700 - 00:12:14.600</b><br>but what you want your scanner to do<br></p><p><b>00:12:14.733 - 00:12:18.700</b><br>is you want your scanner to find the bottom of a range<br></p><p><b>00:12:18.966 - 00:12:21.333</b><br>and then a drop below that bottom<br></p><p><b>00:12:21.333 - 00:12:22.133</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.466 - 00:12:25.566</b><br>and then you want your scanner to<br></p><p><b>00:12:25.566 - 00:12:26.333</b><br>alert you<br></p><p><b>00:12:26.333 - 00:12:29.200</b><br>only if there's still coins left to be bought<br></p><p><b>00:12:29.200 - 00:12:30.300</b><br>at the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:12:30.600 - 00:12:32.166</b><br>right you don't need an alert<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.300 - 00:12:34.900</b><br>if it just spiked down and it went right back up<br></p><p><b>00:12:34.900 - 00:12:36.400</b><br>and you just have no chance to get in<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.400 - 00:12:37.566</b><br>you missed the whole spike<br></p><p><b>00:12:37.566 - 00:12:39.466</b><br>you never put your layers in<br></p><p><b>00:12:39.533 -

00:12:45.166</b><br>just be alerted if it<br></p><p><b>00:12:45.166 - 00:12:45.966</b><br>spiked down<br></p><p><b>00:12:45.966 - 00:12:48.566</b><br>and there's still coins there for you to buy<br></p><p><b>00:12:49.200 - 00:12:51.366</b><br>so that's what the point of that is<br></p><p><b>00:12:51.466 - 00:12:54.366</b><br>so if somebody big decided to sell<br></p><p><b>00:12:54.366 - 00:12:59.366</b><br>all of his load at 44 point 000 44<br></p><p><b>00:13:00.100 - 00:13:02.966</b><br>if he decided to sell 100,000 coins there<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.133 - 00:13:05.066</b><br>and he just wrote that order<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.200 - 00:13:07.600</b><br>then he'll have eaten all of this book<br></p><p><b>00:13:07.600 - 00:13:09.200</b><br>all the way down to 4<br></p><p><b>00:13:09.766 - 00:13:11.466</b><br>to point zero zero four four<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.266 - 00:13:14.900</b><br>and then he'll still have some right because<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.400 - 00:13:17.366</b><br>he wanted to sell 100,000 coins<br></p><p><b>00:13:17.366 - 00:13:20.900</b><br>so maybe he sold 30,000 and he's got 60,000 left<br></p><p><b>00:13:21.000 - 00:13:22.166</b><br>on that order<br></p><p><b>00:13:22.400 - 00:13:24.866</b><br>well that order will now be the ask<br></p><p><b>00:13:24.900 - 00:13:28.066</b><br>so that order that ask would be sitting right here at<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.466 - 00:13:31.700</b><br>000 44 and the very next one<br></p><p><b>00:13:31.766 - 00:13:33.300</b><br>in line on the book<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.300 - 00:13:35.400</b><br>would be all the way back up here at 52<br></p><p><b>00:13:35.600 - 00:13:38.733</b><br>you know like you just have this weird low<br></p><p><b>00:13:39.000 - 00:13:41.166</b><br>ask for a few seconds<br></p><p><b>00:13:41.666 - 00:13:44.666</b><br>that's what the scanner finds it finds out<br></p><p><b>00:13:44.800 - 00:13:46.266</b><br>it alerts you<br></p><p><b>00:13:46.500 - 00:13:49.500</b><br>if there's still some coins left to buy<br></p><p><b>00:13:50.300 - 00:13:53.733</b><br>at a very low when there's been a drop below a range<br></p><p><b>00:13:53.733 - 00:13:55.766</b><br>could you ask for anything better than that<br></p><p><b>00:13:56.966 - 00:14:00.533</b><br>okay so going back to mine all you got to do again is<br></p><p><b>00:14:00.533 - 00:14:02.133</b><br>on this fat finger section<br></p><p><b>00:14:02.566 - 00:14:04.466</b><br>you go and hit edit filters<br></p><p><b>00:14:04.466 - 00:14:07.600</b><br>and you can see that I put my drops at<br></p><p><b>00:14:07.800 - 00:14:09.133</b><br>minus three %<br></p><p><b>00:14:09.133 - 00:14:11.800</b><br>because I don't want to be alerted with the drops<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.800 - 00:14:13.800</b><br>so I just don't have that highlighted<br></p><p><b>00:14:14.466 - 00:14:16.800</b><br>but I put my fat finger percentage at 15<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.966 - 00:14:19.133</b><br>I want anything that's a drop<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.200 - 00:14:21.000</b><br>below the bottom of a range<br></p><p><b>00:14:21.466 - 00:14:23.733</b><br>more than 15 percent you know<br></p><p><b>00:14:23.766 - 00:14:26.500</b><br>20 percent 30 percent I want an alert<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.500 - 00:14:28.800</b><br>and then you just click on this little<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.333 - 00:14:31.133</b><br>checkmark<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.366 - 00:14:32.966</b><br>and you will get that sound<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.400 - 00:14:36.266</b><br>whenever it meets those requirements<br></p><p><b>00:14:36.933 - 00:14:37.733</b><br>so again<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.900 - 00:14:40.300</b><br>this is not the only base scanner that we have<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.300 - 00:14:43.400</b><br>but this is the only base scanner that I'm aware of<br></p><p><b>00:14:43.400 - 00:14:45.533</b><br>with this fat finger scanner<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.366 - 00:14:49.700</b><br>so there's a plug for Benoist and<br></p><p><b>00:14:50.466 - 00:14:53.000</b><br>I'm never going to ask for money from anybody<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.000 - 00:14:55.000</b><br>and I don't get anything from this<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.400 - 00:14:56.200</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.333 - 00:14:58.900</b><br>if he wants to keep allowing me to use this for free<br></p><p><b>00:14:58.900 - 00:15:00.000</b><br>that's fantastic<br></p></body></html>
