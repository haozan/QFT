00:00:07.966</b><br>I haven't made a video in a while and<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.066 - 00:00:09.766</b><br>it's because I don't really have much left to say<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.766 - 00:00:11.500</b><br>I mean I think that<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.500 - 00:00:13.166</b><br>my series so far<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.166 - 00:00:15.266</b><br>is kind of on my blog kind of speaks for itself<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.500 - 00:00:18.766</b><br>and everybody that's interested in finding out how I<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.766 -

00:01:00.966</b><br>and that especially if you have a small account<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.166 - 00:01:02.133</b><br>then you're<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.366 - 00:01:04.200</b><br>you're antsy because how are you going to build it<br></p><p><b>00:01:04.200 -

00:01:11.900</b><br>how long is that gonna<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.900 - 00:01:13.666</b><br>take if I have to wait for these base<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.666 - 00:01:15.166</b><br>cracks and<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.166 - 00:01:16.266</b><br>you know on one hour<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.266 - 00:01:18.200</b><br>charts and I'm waiting for these base<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.200 - 00:01:19.166</b><br>cracks and although<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.166 - 00:01:20.066</b><br>they are<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.566 - 00:01:22.966</b><br>guaranteed money and I know that it's gonna work out<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.966 - 00:01:24.966</b><br>and it works out 100% of time on<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.966 - 00:01:26.500</b><br>you know the major coins and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.366 - 00:01:29.500</b><br>oh man to wait for that you know<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.500 - 00:01:30.933</b><br>and with a little account<br></p><p><b>00:01:30.933 - 00:01:32.766</b><br>so you're looking for those little account builder<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.766 - 00:01:33.700</b><br>traits and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.200 - 00:01:37.533</b><br>but if you're looking to technical analysis<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.900 - 00:01:41.100</b><br>to regular ordinary technical analysis that everybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.100 - 00:01:42.100</b><br>else teaches<br></p><p><b>00:01:42.933 - 00:01:44.766</b><br>the chat room is not really for you<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.766 - 00:01:46.866</b><br>and my blog is not really for you<br></p><p><b>00:01:48.000 - 00:01:48.800</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.133 - 00:01:52.066</b><br>you're going to start to lead yourself down a road<br></p><p><b>00:01:52.066 - 00:01:53.133</b><br>that takes you away<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.133 - 00:01:54.766</b><br>from having the odds in your favor<br></p><p><b>00:01:57.133 - 00:01:58.766</b><br>I apologize I'm gonna have to pause the video<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.766 - 00:01:59.366</b><br>every once in a while<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.366 - 00:02:01.266</b><br>because I've got a bit of a sore throat<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.266 - 00:02:02.733</b><br>kind of a persistent cough<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.300 - 00:02:06.733</b><br>and so just bear with me I've got a warm beverage here<br></p><p><b>00:02:06.733 - 00:02:07.266</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.266 - 00:02:09.266</b><br>I'll sit my beverage every once in a while and I'll<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.333 - 00:02:10.366</b><br>help my throw it out<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.900 - 00:02:15.566</b><br>okay so here's the theory with technical analysis right<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.966 - 00:02:17.400</b><br>so there's a ton of different<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.800 - 00:02:19.466</b><br>indicators and things you can do<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.466 - 00:02:21.200</b><br>so tons of stuff you can look at<br></p><p><b>00:02:22.366 - 00:02:23.666</b><br>but the theory is that<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.900 - 00:02:28.700</b><br>technical analysis creates self fulfilling prophecies<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.166 - 00:02:32.266</b><br>right so if everybody is looking for this<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.266 - 00:02:34.566</b><br>certain candlestick<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.966 - 00:02:37.066</b><br>and as soon as that prints<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.066 - 00:02:39.466</b><br>everybody's ready to take the opposite side trade<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.000 - 00:02:44.800</b><br>that candlestick although it means nothing in itself<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.300 - 00:02:47.533</b><br>the fact that you got that candlestick<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.766 - 00:02:49.766</b><br>creates a condition<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.300 - 00:02:53.200</b><br>where everybody buys and turns the price around<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.200 - 00:02:55.666</b><br>that's kind of like the theory behind it<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.866 - 00:02:59.200</b><br>or in the case of Fibonacci levels you know<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.866 - 00:03:04.466</b><br>something from the peak to the valley and you put this<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.566 - 00:03:07.533</b><br>Fibonacci retracement levels in there and<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.600 - 00:03:08.366</b><br>you expect that at<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.366 - 00:03:10.466</b><br>50 percent that price is going to turn again<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.800 - 00:03:13.933</b><br>you know and it barely ever does but<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.133 - 00:03:15.566</b><br>the idea is that<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.400 - 00:03:18.566</b><br>everybody's watching the Fibonacci levels<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.566 - 00:03:20.266</b><br>and at a certain<br></p><p><b>00:03:20.533 - 00:03:23.466</b><br>at these price points you expect it to turn around and<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.466 - 00:03:24.800</b><br>soon as it starts to turn around<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.800 - 00:03:25.900</b><br>everybody's going to jump on board<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.900 - 00:03:26.466</b><br>because they're like<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.466 - 00:03:29.000</b><br>oh there's the Fibonacci levels we were looking for<br></p><p><b>00:03:29.333 - 00:03:32.800</b><br>and it fulfills its own prophecy the reality is though<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.133 - 00:03:35.500</b><br>that there is a ton of indicators<br></p><p><b>00:03:35.733 - 00:03:38.300</b><br>and there's a ton of different ways to look at<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.366 - 00:03:39.766</b><br>technical analysis<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.900 - 00:03:41.400</b><br>and therefore<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.400 - 00:03:42.766</b><br>pretty well<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.766 - 00:03:45.066</b><br>most of your trades are gonna be the wrong trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.133 - 00:03:48.766</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.766 - 00:03:50.066</b><br>because there are so many people<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.066 - 00:03:51.766</b><br>using so many different indicators<br></p><p><b>00:03:51.866 - 00:03:53.933</b><br>no one indicator seems to work very good<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.933 - 00:03:55.800</b><br>right if you're interested in one thing<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.500 - 00:03:57.733</b><br>you'll be like wait a second<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.733 - 00:03:59.300</b><br>how come it's just not working<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.333 - 00:04:00.333</b><br>and it's because<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.600 - 00:04:03.600</b><br>one guy is looking at Fivonacci levels and another<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.600 -

00:04:10.200</b><br>guy is looking at just regular moving averages<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.200 - 00:04:11.066</b><br>and trying to<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.100 - 00:04:12.066</b><br>you know we're in an up try and<br></p><p><b>00:04:12.066 -

00:05:25.866</b><br>let's start<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.866 - 00:05:28.200</b><br>with Fibonacci levels because there's so many people<br></p><p><b>00:05:28.466 - 00:05:31.866</b><br>that go after Fibonacci levels thinking that somehow<br></p><p><b>00:05:31.866 -

00:05:46.133</b><br>where can they get out of a good trade or<br></p><p><b>00:05:46.200 - 00:05:48.500</b><br>where can they take a trade that's even riskier<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.500 - 00:05:49.300</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:05:49.766 - 00:05:50.700</b><br>so let's take a look<br></p><p><b>00:05:51.866 - 00:05:54.666</b><br>so generally what you do is you identify a trend right<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.666 - 00:05:56.533</b><br>so you're in an up trend or you're in a down trend<br></p><p><b>00:05:56.533 -

00:06:03.800</b><br>and you know it hit whatever<br></p><p><b>00:06:04.100 - 00:06:07.266</b><br>5000 almost and then it starts working its way down<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.200 - 00:06:09.800</b><br>and it gets all the way down to 3000<br></p><p><b>00:06:10.533 - 00:06:12.500</b><br>so you're in and down train over here<br></p><p><b>00:06:12.766 - 00:06:14.600</b><br>and what you're doing with the Binachi<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.733 - 00:06:16.500</b><br>levels is you're looking for a swing high and<br></p><p><b>00:06:16.500 - 00:06:17.733</b><br>swing low right<br></p><p><b>00:06:17.766 - 00:06:18.533</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:06:18.533 - 00:06:20.966</b><br>and then when you grab that swing high and swing low<br></p><p><b>00:06:20.966 - 00:06:22.933</b><br>so let's grab this swing high right here<br></p><p><b>00:06:24.000 - 00:06:26.700</b><br>and we take it all the way down to the swing low right<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.800 - 00:06:29.700</b><br>to there and what should happen<br></p><p><b>00:06:29.933 - 00:06:32.366</b><br>is it should hit a Fibonacci level<br></p><p><b>00:06:32.933 - 00:06:37.466</b><br>and turn and usually that's the 518 level right here<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.900 - 00:06:43.366</b><br>right so this is a good place to take a short or to<br></p><p><b>00:06:44.133 - 00:06:45.000</b><br>sell your position<br></p><p><b>00:06:46.133 - 00:06:46.466</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:06:46.466 - 00:06:48.200</b><br>so you've identified a swing high<br></p><p><b>00:06:48.200 - 00:06:49.866</b><br>you've identified a swing low<br></p><p><b>00:06:50.133 - 00:06:51.266</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:06:52.000 - 00:06:54.933</b><br>right here look at these three bars right there<br></p><p><b>00:06:55.700 - 00:06:57.666</b><br>those three bars look like<br></p><p><b>00:06:57.933 - 00:07:00.300</b><br>maybe it's about to turn right off of this<br></p><p><b>00:07:00.533 - 00:07:01.766</b><br>sorry what is that level<br></p><p><b>00:07:02.500 - 00:07:04.466</b><br>right off of this 50 percent level<br></p><p><b>00:07:04.466 - 00:07:08.500</b><br>oh beautiful but nope keeps going<br></p><p><b>00:07:08.900 - 00:07:10.800</b><br>okay wait a second here what about<br></p><p><b>00:07:11.400 - 00:07:12.900</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:07:12.900 - 00:07:14.933</b><br>look at this little spot right here<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.333 - 00:07:16.366</b><br>let me just move<br></p><p><b>00:07:17.000 - 00:07:18.566</b><br>the screen over if I can<br></p><p><b>00:07:21.900 - 00:07:22.700</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:07:23.366 - 00:07:25.900</b><br>what about this level right here<br></p><p><b>00:07:25.966 - 00:07:28.266</b><br>maybe right there you were thinking hey<br></p><p><b>00:07:28.266 - 00:07:29.100</b><br>look at that<br></p><p><b>00:07:29.466 - 00:07:30.900</b><br>that looks like it's ready to turn around<br></p><p><b>00:07:30.900 - 00:07:32.500</b><br>right off of this point<br></p><p><b>00:07:32.500 - 00:07:35.333</b><br>618 Fibonacci level<br></p><p><b>00:07:35.866 - 00:07:38.400</b><br>ah nope keeps going up<br></p><p><b>00:07:38.700 - 00:07:39.666</b><br>comes back down<br></p><p><b>00:07:39.666 - 00:07:43.733</b><br>oh looks like it bounced off of this 50 percent level<br></p><p><b>00:07:44.400 - 00:07:47.900</b><br>and then back up into the middle<br></p><p><b>00:07:47.966 - 00:07:49.600</b><br>of the 61<br></p><p><b>00:07:50.100 - 00:07:52.000</b><br>so should I maybe start<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.966 - 00:07:54.133</b><br>maybe I should start<br></p><p><b>00:07:56.166 - 00:07:58.533</b><br>sticking in lines in the center of these<br></p><p><b>00:07:58.533 - 00:08:01.133</b><br>because look that kind of bounced right off the center<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.733 - 00:08:02.533</b><br>and then<br></p><p><b>00:08:02.533 - 00:08:05.266</b><br>if you put a line over here look doesn't it look like<br></p><p><b>00:08:06.733 - 00:08:08.533</b><br>like when it came back this time<br></p><p><b>00:08:08.533 - 00:08:09.866</b><br>it kind of almost went to the<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.866 - 00:08:11.266</b><br>center and then bounced it<br></p><p><b>00:08:11.566 - 00:08:12.533</b><br>like what are you going to start doing<br></p><p><b>00:08:12.533 - 00:08:14.066</b><br>drawing lines all over the place<br></p><p><b>00:08:15.166 - 00:08:16.266</b><br>okay so okay<br></p><p><b>00:08:16.266 - 00:08:17.700</b><br>so that one didn't work whatever<br></p><p><b>00:08:18.133 - 00:08:19.266</b><br>let's keep looking<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.400 - 00:08:19.733</b><br>all right<br></p><p><b>00:08:19.733 - 00:08:20.533</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.566 - 00:08:23.166</b><br>here's another swing high and here's another swing low<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.300 - 00:08:25.666</b><br>all right so let's grab our little extension tool<br></p><p><b>00:08:26.100 - 00:08:30.100</b><br>so right there's a swing high right there's a swing low<br></p><p><b>00:08:30.766 - 00:08:31.566</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:08:33.933 - 00:08:35.800</b><br>there's that 50 percent level<br></p><p><b>00:08:36.333 - 00:08:39.200</b><br>so it comes up to the 50 percent level<br></p><p><b>00:08:39.766 - 00:08:43.066</b><br>and it turns on it hey that's pretty good right there<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.266 - 00:08:45.200</b><br>and it comes up to the 50 percent level<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.200 - 00:08:46.766</b><br>again and it turns on it<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.133 - 00:08:49.266</b><br>now I don't know what this little<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.333 - 00:08:50.733</b><br>thing was about because it<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.800 - 00:08:52.366</b><br>wasn't hitting any kind of level but<br></p><p><b>00:08:52.466 - 00:08:54.966</b><br>that's clearly a 50 percent level<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.966 - 00:08:57.000</b><br>maybe this Fibonacci thing does work<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.900 - 00:08:59.400</b><br>alright so let's get rid of that<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.466 - 00:09:03.066</b><br>so now here we have a swing high and a swing low again<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.133 - 00:09:04.566</b><br>so let's check it out<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.366 - 00:09:07.666</b><br>so we're gonna call this right here our swing high<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.366 - 00:09:10.000</b><br>and there's our swing low<br></p><p><b>00:09:10.666 - 00:09:13.866</b><br>and let me just move that out so we get the levels<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.266 - 00:09:16.466</b><br>and alright so here's our beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.466 - 00:09:16.700</b><br></p><p><b>00:09:16.700 - 00:09:18.766</b><br>percent level that we're used to seeing that we should<br></p><p><b>00:09:18.766 - 00:09:20.366</b><br>we should stop there right guys<br></p><p><b>00:09:20.866 - 00:09:21.700</b><br>comes up<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.800 - 00:09:24.666</b><br>turns a little bit keeps going<br></p><p><b>00:09:25.100 - 00:09:28.200</b><br>oh wait a second now look 61.8<br></p><p><b>00:09:28.900 - 00:09:30.966</b><br>there we go it looks like it hit that and<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.966 - 00:09:32.500</b><br>really turned off of that<br></p><p><b>00:09:32.500 - 00:09:33.300</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.866 - 00:09:37.700</b><br>well yeah it did and then it came down to the 38 point<br></p><p><b>00:09:37.766 - 00:09:39.900</b><br>two and then it turned around<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.900 - 00:09:41.333</b><br>and went all the way up to the<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.333 - 00:09:42.333</b><br></p><p><b>00:09:42.400 - 00:09:47.666</b><br>point6 but not really more like the 70 more like the 80<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.866 - 00:09:48.966</b><br>or 81<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.566 - 00:09:50.666</b><br>before it turned<br></p><p><b>00:09:50.966 - 00:09:52.900</b><br>and it came down and<br></p><p><b>00:09:54.000 - 00:09:55.533</b><br>can you start to see that<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.566 - 00:09:57.400</b><br>there is no real way to<br></p><p><b>00:09:57.666 - 00:09:59.066</b><br>like I know these are supposed to be<br></p><p><b>00:09:59.066 - 00:10:01.066</b><br>general spots is what they say but<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.666 - 00:10:02.766</b><br>I mean the 50<br></p><p><b>00:10:02.766 - 00:10:04.533</b><br>percent didn't work but it worked over there<br></p><p><b>00:10:04.533 - 00:10:06.466</b><br>and now the 61.8<br></p><p><b>00:10:06.700 - 00:10:08.733</b><br>it kind of turned it maybe<br></p><p><b>00:10:08.766 - 00:10:11.533</b><br>and then this one over here was a little too high<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.533 - 00:10:13.300</b><br>but it still kind of turned it<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.133 - 00:10:16.366</b><br>are these marks<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.366 - 00:10:16.933</b><br>are these<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.933 - 00:10:19.066</b><br>Fibonacci levels really working<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.966 - 00:10:20.766</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.566 - 00:10:23.366</b><br>let's<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.466 - 00:10:24.100</b><br>just draw<br></p><p><b>00:10:24.100 - 00:10:26.700</b><br>random lines and see what happens with random lines<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.600 - 00:10:29.800</b><br>okay so just to randomly make some lines<br></p><p><b>00:10:29.800 - 00:10:31.366</b><br>let's go into the past<br></p><p><b>00:10:32.166 - 00:10:33.166</b><br>just go into the past<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.166 - 00:10:35.533</b><br>and let's grab this little tool right here<br></p><p><b>00:10:35.766 - 00:10:39.533</b><br>we just start drawing lines and lines here and there<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.533 - 00:10:40.500</b><br>everywhere we want<br></p><p><b>00:10:41.100 -

00:10:48.800</b><br>just randomly throwing lines in wherever we feel<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.800 - 00:10:50.666</b><br>we want to stick some lines<br></p><p><b>00:10:50.666 - 00:10:51.466</b><br>do<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.900 - 00:10:52.800</b><br>a pope<br></p><p><b>00:10:53.566 - 00:10:55.866</b><br>I don't know how far we can get down here<br></p><p><b>00:10:55.866 - 00:10:57.266</b><br>let's move the chartle of it so we<br></p><p><b>00:10:57.266 - 00:10:58.266</b><br>can get a little lower<br></p><p><b>00:11:00.533 - 00:11:02.300</b><br>just randomly sticking lines<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.066 - 00:11:04.533</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.533 - 00:11:07.366</b><br>so just random lines right so let's go into the<br></p><p><b>00:11:07.400 - 00:11:08.200</b><br>future<br></p><p><b>00:11:08.333 - 00:11:10.533</b><br>just take a look and see what happens with just<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.533 - 00:11:11.200</b><br>random lines<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.200 - 00:11:12.533</b><br>nothing to do with Pivonacci<br></p><p><b>00:11:13.200 - 00:11:15.400</b><br>just random everyday lines<br></p><p><b>00:11:19.000 - 00:11:20.466</b><br>em well<br></p><p><b>00:11:21.966 - 00:11:23.000</b><br>that sucks<br></p><p><b>00:11:25.700 - 00:11:26.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:11:28.300 - 00:11:30.066</b><br>all right so here's our top<br></p><p><b>00:11:30.133 - 00:11:30.533</b><br>right<br></p><p><b>00:11:30.533 - 00:11:32.333</b><br>we don't know where the bottom is going to be<br></p><p><b>00:11:32.400 - 00:11:35.400</b><br>but look at this beautiful bounce off this line<br></p><p><b>00:11:35.400 - 00:11:37.366</b><br>it's like this line was perfect<br></p><p><b>00:11:37.733 - 00:11:38.866</b><br>and then it works its way up<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.866 - 00:11:41.933</b><br>and well okay it kind of went through that line<br></p><p><b>00:11:41.933 - 00:11:43.766</b><br>so like I did with the pivonaccis<br></p><p><b>00:11:44.066 - 00:11:45.533</b><br>kind of went through the line then turn<br></p><p><b>00:11:45.600 - 00:11:47.733</b><br>but then look at this support<br></p><p><b>00:11:47.733 - 00:11:49.700</b><br>look how it's just bouncing off that line<br></p><p><b>00:11:49.700 - 00:11:50.500</b><br>and when it finally<br></p><p><b>00:11:50.500 - 00:11:52.533</b><br>cracks that line it goes to the other line<br></p><p><b>00:11:52.800 - 00:11:54.500</b><br>and bounces off that too<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.766 - 00:11:55.133</b><br>and that<br></p><p><b>00:11:55.133 - 00:11:58.000</b><br>comes up to the top and it bounces off of this line<br></p><p><b>00:11:59.000 -

00:12:28.133</b><br>looking at them<br></p><p><b>00:12:28.133 - 00:12:31.133</b><br>and actually this seems like it was even more more<br></p><p><b>00:12:33.700 - 00:12:36.333</b><br>reliable than the Fibonaccis because look how<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.333 - 00:12:39.100</b><br>nicely some of these lines touched perfectly<br></p><p><b>00:12:41.366 - 00:12:41.666</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:12:41.666 - 00:12:44.866</b><br>so let's take that off the screen these random lines<br></p><p><b>00:12:44.933 - 00:12:46.600</b><br>and let's take a look at<br></p><p><b>00:12:47.200 - 00:12:48.666</b><br>one of my favorites<br></p><p><b>00:12:49.600 - 00:12:51.866</b><br>and that's a wrong one wrong button<br></p><p><b>00:12:51.900 - 00:12:53.866</b><br>one of my favorites is Bolandra Vans<br></p><p><b>00:12:54.100 - 00:12:55.500</b><br>I like Bolandra Vans<br></p><p><b>00:12:57.933 - 00:12:59.066</b><br>alright so<br></p><p><b>00:12:59.766 - 00:13:00.933</b><br>here's some Bullinger bands<br></p><p><b>00:13:00.933 - 00:13:03.566</b><br>the reason that I like Pollinger bands not to trade<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.566 - 00:13:05.333</b><br>I just like the idea of the concept of it<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.333 - 00:13:07.266</b><br>is because it makes new traders<br></p><p><b>00:13:07.266 - 00:13:08.066</b><br>think about<br></p><p><b>00:13:08.800 - 00:13:10.500</b><br>getting in at least at the right place<br></p><p><b>00:13:10.600 - 00:13:12.866</b><br>at least getting in on extremes<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.866 - 00:13:15.800</b><br>so the way Bullinger bands work is you have a<br></p><p><b>00:13:16.066 - 00:13:16.733</b><br>moving average<br></p><p><b>00:13:16.733 - 00:13:18.166</b><br>and that's that center line right here<br></p><p><b>00:13:18.166 - 00:13:19.500</b><br>that's going through the chart<br></p><p><b>00:13:19.866 - 00:13:21.133</b><br>you have a moving average<br></p><p><b>00:13:21.666 - 00:13:23.466</b><br>here let me just draw this out for you for a sec<br></p><p><b>00:13:25.533 - 00:13:25.866</b><br>all right<br></p><p><b>00:13:25.866 - 00:13:26.966</b><br>so I just did a<br></p><p><b>00:13:27.133 - 00:13:29.333</b><br>paint and I did a really crappy sketch<br></p><p><b>00:13:29.333 - 00:13:30.400</b><br>but the idea<br></p><p><b>00:13:30.400 - 00:13:32.333</b><br>is that you have moving average that moves in the<br></p><p><b>00:13:32.333 - 00:13:35.666</b><br>center and then there's a standard deviation<br></p><p><b>00:13:35.666 - 00:13:37.266</b><br>like they're looking for what<br></p><p><b>00:13:37.466 - 00:13:39.733</b><br>on average how far does it move<br></p><p><b>00:13:40.300 - 00:13:41.700</b><br>and then they're<br></p><p><b>00:13:41.700 - 00:13:43.933</b><br>plotting these little green lines based on<br></p><p><b>00:13:43.933 - 00:13:45.966</b><br>what the average move is<br></p><p><b>00:13:46.100 - 00:13:47.000</b><br>in this coin<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.466 - 00:13:50.766</b><br>and so when it touches one of these lines<br></p><p><b>00:13:50.766 - 00:13:52.966</b><br>you've got a beautiful little bi spot right<br></p><p><b>00:13:52.966 - 00:13:54.266</b><br>and when it gets to the top<br></p><p><b>00:13:54.266 - 00:13:55.700</b><br>you have a beautiful cell spot<br></p><p><b>00:13:55.700 - 00:13:57.066</b><br>and it gets to the bottom you got a beautiful<br></p><p><b>00:13:57.200 - 00:13:57.900</b><br>bi spot<br></p><p><b>00:13:57.900 - 00:14:00.366</b><br>and basically these are the extremes of the chart<br></p><p><b>00:14:00.766 - 00:14:03.933</b><br>now the reason that I like this indicator<br></p><p><b>00:14:04.100 - 00:14:08.366</b><br>more than most indicators is because at least traders<br></p><p><b>00:14:08.700 - 00:14:13.766</b><br>will buy in or sell at the extremes of an average range<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.766 - 00:14:15.000</b><br>like they're looking at a range<br></p><p><b>00:14:15.000 - 00:14:16.600</b><br>and they're getting in on the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.600 - 00:14:18.000</b><br>and selling on the top<br></p><p><b>00:14:18.000 - 00:14:19.000</b><br>and that's great<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.133 - 00:14:21.166</b><br>the other thing is that<br></p><p><b>00:14:21.933 - 00:14:26.466</b><br>it makes you just because of the way it's shown<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.533 - 00:14:28.600</b><br>it makes you look at odds<br></p><p><b>00:14:28.700 - 00:14:30.166</b><br>you're like oh it worked here<br></p><p><b>00:14:30.166 - 00:14:32.100</b><br>it worked here it worked here it worked here<br></p><p><b>00:14:32.100 - 00:14:32.700</b><br>it worked here<br></p><p><b>00:14:32.700 - 00:14:33.500</b><br>it worked here<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.566 - 00:14:35.600</b><br>it worked here it worked here it worked here<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.866 - 00:14:39.200</b><br>my odds are something like 90 percent or 100 percent<br></p><p><b>00:14:39.200 - 00:14:41.933</b><br>you know like you're able to count your odds out<br></p><p><b>00:14:41.966 - 00:14:44.900</b><br>and that's what I always try to tell everybody is to<br></p><p><b>00:14:45.366 - 00:14:47.166</b><br>especially with the small account building trades<br></p><p><b>00:14:47.166 - 00:14:47.966</b><br>you're looking for<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.200 - 00:14:49.566</b><br>things that are ranging<br></p><p><b>00:14:49.700 - 00:14:51.333</b><br>and that are predictable<br></p><p><b>00:14:51.333 - 00:14:52.100</b><br>and that you can<br></p><p><b>00:14:52.100 - 00:14:53.333</b><br>look in the past and kind of<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.333 - 00:14:55.600</b><br>count your odds and know what your odds are<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.600 - 00:14:58.200</b><br>and then with our position trades where we're taking<br></p><p><b>00:14:58.900 - 00:15:00.100</b><br>panics off of<br></p><p><b>00:15:00.700 - 00:15:02.533</b><br>bases that got cracked<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.566 - 00:15:04.266</b><br>you're able to look in the past and be like yeah<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.266 - 00:15:06.333</b><br>this thing always respects its basis<br></p><p><b>00:15:06.533 - 00:15:09.200</b><br>that's what I want to trade my odds are high right<br></p><p><b>00:15:09.800 - 00:15:13.500</b><br>so of all the indicators I kind of like Ballinger vans<br></p><p><b>00:15:13.533 - 00:15:15.666</b><br>but I would never ever trade by them<br></p><p><b>00:15:15.900 - 00:15:16.900</b><br>like I just wouldn't<br></p><p><b>00:15:16.900 - 00:15:18.333</b><br>I'm just saying that<br></p><p><b>00:15:18.933 - 00:15:22.866</b><br>if you're looking at a crap load of garbage indicators<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.533 - 00:15:25.900</b><br>Ballinger bands is maybe<br></p><p><b>00:15:25.933 - 00:15:28.400</b><br>one of the ones that are on the top of the crack heat<br></p><p><b>00:15:29.466 - 00:15:32.200</b><br>so if you take a look at sorry<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.900 - 00:15:35.300</b><br>I don't know what I'm doing<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.366 - 00:15:41.300</b><br>I can't get rid of it I'll just move it with my hands<br></p><p><b>00:15:41.700 - 00:15:42.500</b><br>all right<br></p><p><b>00:15:43.066 - 00:15:44.366</b><br>so if you take a look at<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.166 - 00:15:46.866</b><br>Ballinger bands right here<br></p><p><b>00:15:46.966 - 00:15:47.933</b><br>you'll see that<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.100 - 00:15:51.200</b><br>it goes up it touches the top it comes back down<br></p><p><b>00:15:51.400 - 00:15:54.300</b><br>and if you were to randomly buy and sell<br></p><p><b>00:15:54.300 - 00:15:56.000</b><br>based on Ballinger bands<br></p><p><b>00:15:56.300 - 00:15:58.166</b><br>sometimes you'd make some pretty good money<br></p><p><b>00:15:58.166 - 00:16:00.100</b><br>because you'd buy<br></p><p><b>00:16:00.100 -

00:16:07.066</b><br>there's an even<br></p><p><b>00:16:07.333 - 00:16:09.600</b><br>and then you'd buy and guess what<br></p><p><b>00:16:09.600 - 00:16:12.400</b><br>it never got to the top of the Bullinger van<br></p><p><b>00:16:12.400 - 00:16:13.700</b><br>so did you sell<br></p><p><b>00:16:14.366 - 00:16:15.966</b><br>I don't know probably not<br></p><p><b>00:16:16.166 - 00:16:17.000</b><br>and then guess what<br></p><p><b>00:16:17.000 - 00:16:19.600</b><br>it's hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting<br></p><p><b>00:16:20.266 - 00:16:22.366</b><br>and it doesn't get back to the top of the Ballinger van<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.366 - 00:16:23.166</b><br>here<br></p><p><b>00:16:23.400 - 00:16:25.966</b><br>and that would actually be very close to a break even<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.966 - 00:16:28.566</b><br>maybe a little bit of a loss there right<br></p><p><b>00:16:28.566 - 00:16:31.466</b><br>and then you buy here and you sell and you get a win<br></p><p><b>00:16:32.266 - 00:16:34.500</b><br>and then unfortunately you'd buy here<br></p><p><b>00:16:35.300 - 00:16:37.266</b><br>and it would go run away from you<br></p><p><b>00:16:37.466 - 00:16:39.700</b><br>and the time you finally get to sell with you<br></p><p><b>00:16:39.700 - 00:16:41.166</b><br>either right here<br></p><p><b>00:16:41.400 - 00:16:42.800</b><br>or over here somewhere<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.900 -

00:26:31.000</b><br>so these guys<br></p><p><b>00:26:31.533 - 00:26:33.666</b><br>can keep on shorting against you<br></p><p><b>00:26:33.666 - 00:26:34.900</b><br>and shorting against you<br></p><p><b>00:26:34.900 - 00:26:35.700</b><br>and while you're<br></p><p><b>00:26:35.700 - 00:26:37.333</b><br>taking long positions up here<br></p><p><b>00:26:37.333 - 00:26:39.100</b><br>and you're taking long positions up here<br></p><p><b>00:26:39.100 - 00:26:39.866</b><br>and you're taking<br></p><p><b>00:26:39.866 - 00:26:41.733</b><br>because you keep thinking this is a breakout<br></p><p><b>00:26:41.900 - 00:26:42.900</b><br>they can be shorting and<br></p><p><b>00:26:42.900 - 00:26:44.533</b><br>shorting and shorting and shorting and shorting<br></p><p><b>00:26:44.533 - 00:26:46.100</b><br>against you when they got enough<br></p><p><b>00:26:46.733 - 00:26:47.566</b><br>against you<br></p><p><b>00:26:48.333 - 00:26:50.133</b><br>when there's enough people that are now<br></p><p><b>00:26:50.133 - 00:26:52.533</b><br>long on this position they can<br></p><p><b>00:26:52.866 - 00:26:56.666</b><br>make a big long red bar to panic you out of<br></p><p><b>00:26:57.533 - 00:27:00.166</b><br>your coins that you had just bought up there<br></p><p><b>00:27:00.733 - 00:27:03.600</b><br>and once you start panicking out of your coins<br></p><p><b>00:27:03.900 - 00:27:06.800</b><br>they can cover their shorts and buy them back<br></p><p><b>00:27:06.966 - 00:27:08.066</b><br>so what we need<br></p><p><b>00:27:08.100 - 00:27:10.200</b><br>is a very very<br></p><p><b>00:27:10.200 - 00:27:10.733</b><br>obvious<br></p><p><b>00:27:10.733 - 00:27:13.666</b><br>trick that the big money uses over and over and over<br></p><p><b>00:27:14.666 - 00:27:18.333</b><br>so that's why we start off with using one hour candles<br></p><p><b>00:27:18.600 - 00:27:21.866</b><br>because the big money uses higher time frames<br></p><p><b>00:27:21.866 - 00:27:23.266</b><br>right they use one hour<br></p><p><b>00:27:23.300 - 00:27:26.800</b><br>they use four hour candles they use one day candles<br></p><p><b>00:27:27.666 - 00:27:30.333</b><br>so they look at much higher time frames<br></p><p><b>00:27:30.333 - 00:27:32.733</b><br>so it has to be obvious to them<br></p><p><b>00:27:32.766 - 00:27:35.100</b><br>so this spot on this chart<br></p><p><b>00:27:36.800 - 00:27:40.700</b><br>is very obvious that is a base that is a spot<br></p><p><b>00:27:40.900 - 00:27:43.733</b><br>that nobody thinks it's going to ever crack<br></p><p><b>00:27:43.733 - 00:27:47.166</b><br>that is a spot that everybody thinks their support at<br></p><p><b>00:27:47.533 - 00:27:51.300</b><br>right and what makes the support of this spot big guys<br></p><p><b>00:27:51.700 - 00:27:53.566</b><br>the big money supports the spot<br></p><p><b>00:27:53.666 - 00:27:56.666</b><br>so if the big money ever stops supporting this spot<br></p><p><b>00:27:57.100 - 00:27:58.700</b><br>it fools everybody<br></p><p><b>00:27:58.766 - 00:28:00.600</b><br>and then people start panicking<br></p><p><b>00:28:01.266 - 00:28:04.566</b><br>but it's the big money that changed their mind<br></p><p><b>00:28:05.066 - 00:28:05.600</b><br>it's the big<br></p><p><b>00:28:05.600 - 00:28:08.933</b><br>money that decided not to support this spot anymore<br></p><p><b>00:28:08.933 - 00:28:11.466</b><br>so who's in control of the chart<br></p><p><b>00:28:12.566 - 00:28:13.533</b><br>the big money<br></p><p><b>00:28:13.900 - 00:28:15.500</b><br>but anyway my point is that<br></p><p><b>00:28:15.900 - 00:28:18.533</b><br>this is an obvious base right<br></p><p><b>00:28:18.866 - 00:28:21.366</b><br>and that's on a 1 hour char 1 hour bar chart<br></p><p><b>00:28:21.366 - 00:28:23.366</b><br>if you go to a 4 hour bar chart<br></p><p><b>00:28:25.333 - 00:28:27.466</b><br>let me just make it so I can move this chart<br></p><p><b>00:28:27.966 - 00:28:29.900</b><br>again obvious space<br></p><p><b>00:28:30.266 - 00:28:32.466</b><br>if you go to a one day bar chart<br></p><p><b>00:28:34.533 - 00:28:35.800</b><br>that candle chart I mean<br></p><p><b>00:28:37.266 - 00:28:38.066</b><br>again<br></p><p><b>00:28:40.133 - 00:28:42.066</b><br>obvious base right<br></p><p><b>00:28:42.066 - 00:28:44.866</b><br>so every time frame is going to say the same thing<br></p><p><b>00:28:45.266 - 00:28:47.100</b><br>on these bigger time frames<br></p><p><b>00:28:47.800 - 00:28:49.100</b><br>let's go back to one hour<br></p><p><b>00:28:52.066 - 00:28:54.533</b><br>so this is an obvious base<br></p><p><b>00:28:54.800 - 00:28:56.600</b><br>and that's why we use it<br></p><p><b>00:28:56.800 - 00:28:59.066</b><br>that's why we trade with these one hour<br></p><p><b>00:29:00.366 - 00:29:03.133</b><br>candles and that's why it has to have a big<br></p><p><b>00:29:03.166 - 00:29:05.666</b><br>reaction a lot of buyers have to come in<br></p><p><b>00:29:05.766 - 00:29:09.166</b><br>and make a nice big bounce for us to qualify that<br></p><p><b>00:29:09.400 - 00:29:10.600</b><br>as a base<br></p><p><b>00:29:10.700 - 00:29:14.500</b><br>and then when the big money stops supporting this spot<br></p><p><b>00:29:15.200 - 00:29:17.466</b><br>then we know what they're doing<br></p><p><b>00:29:19.000 - 00:29:20.600</b><br>does that make sense to everybody<br></p></body></html>
