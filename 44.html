00:00:09.133</b><br>and we're going to be discussing 4x so<br></p><p><b>00:00:09.800 - 00:00:11.766</b><br>this has nothing to do with crypto<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.766 - 00:00:13.000</b><br>and if you're<br></p><p><b>00:00:13.766 - 00:00:16.266</b><br>just trying to learn Quickfingers Luke<br></p><p><b>00:00:16.600 - 00:00:19.466</b><br>trading strategies then just ignore this video<br></p><p><b>00:00:20.300 - 00:00:24.066</b><br>I'm only doing this video about 4x because<br></p><p><b>00:00:24.900 - 00:00:28.100</b><br>it's a really really good example of how<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.366 - 00:00:30.266</b><br>of market mathematics of<br></p><p><b>00:00:30.266 - 00:00:32.733</b><br>putting the odds so far in your favor<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.933 - 00:00:34.533</b><br>that it's almost impossible to lose<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.533 - 00:00:36.266</b><br>and you're going to find that this strategy<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.666 - 00:00:38.666</b><br>which again is not my strategy but<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.733 - 00:00:40.800</b><br>you're going to find that this strategy is<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.800 - 00:00:41.933</b><br>quite simple to<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.000 - 00:00:42.800</b><br>understand<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.500 - 00:00:44.300</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.066 - 00:00:47.400</b><br>kind of hard to execute<br></p><p><b>00:00:47.800 - 00:00:48.600</b><br>like<br></p><p><b>00:00:48.800 - 00:00:51.200</b><br>it takes a lot of discipline to be able to do it<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.200 - 00:00:52.400</b><br>even though it's simple<br></p><p><b>00:00:52.800 - 00:00:54.966</b><br>and you'll be like oh I think I could do that<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.533 - 00:00:56.800</b><br>you still have to follow the<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.800 - 00:00:59.533</b><br>rules and you have to fight your emotions and not take<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.733 - 00:01:01.866</b><br>your profits too quickly and<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.900 - 00:01:04.000</b><br>there's a bunch of rules that you got to follow<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.866 - 00:01:07.000</b><br>which makes it difficult<br></p><p><b>00:01:07.300 - 00:01:08.800</b><br>so I'm not trying to promote<br></p><p><b>00:01:08.866 - 00:01:11.133</b><br>this guy's style of trading<br></p><p><b>00:01:11.800 - 00:01:14.966</b><br>I'm not trying to encourage anybody here to go and<br></p><p><b>00:01:15.133 - 00:01:16.466</b><br>start trading forex<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.466 - 00:01:18.366</b><br>I just want to use this as an example<br></p><p><b>00:01:18.733 - 00:01:22.566</b><br>but often what I do is I look for guys like me<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.600 - 00:01:23.500</b><br>that are out there<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.500 - 00:01:26.866</b><br>guys who are giving their information out for free<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.866 - 00:01:28.700</b><br>they don't want any money from anybody<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.966 - 00:01:31.333</b><br>and they're just explaining how they<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.333 - 00:01:33.666</b><br>trade and they're making their money in the markets<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.666 - 00:01:35.266</b><br>and this is a really good example<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.400 - 00:01:37.700</b><br>of somebody who started with a few thousand<br></p><p><b>00:01:37.766 - 00:01:41.000</b><br>and turned it into millions within like<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.500 - 00:01:42.733</b><br>two years<br></p><p><b>00:01:43.100 - 00:01:46.966</b><br>then in 2010 he joined Forx Factory<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.400 - 00:01:48.700</b><br>on the forum there<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.066 - 00:01:49.733</b><br>he<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.733 - 00:01:53.400</b><br>went into detail and explained exactly how he trades<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.500 - 00:01:55.600</b><br>why he takes the positions he takes<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.600 - 00:01:58.366</b><br>the whole system he explained what he does<br></p><p><b>00:01:59.066 - 00:02:01.000</b><br>so basically at that point<br></p><p><b>00:02:01.500 - 00:02:04.566</b><br>he was only a 2 year old trader<br></p><p><b>00:02:04.733 - 00:02:07.266</b><br>like really really a beginner trader<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.266 - 00:02:09.066</b><br>who just had a very<br></p><p><b>00:02:09.166 - 00:02:10.500</b><br>very good idea<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.966 - 00:02:14.066</b><br>and monopolized on it and then<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.133 - 00:02:15.000</b><br>made so much money<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.000 - 00:02:16.700</b><br>that he was willing to just share it<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.933 - 00:02:19.366</b><br>and so for years later<br></p><p><b>00:02:20.566 - 00:02:23.966</b><br>he kept on answering people's questions on that forum<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.066 - 00:02:25.733</b><br>so there's a lot of data there<br></p><p><b>00:02:26.366 - 00:02:30.266</b><br>there's 366 pages on his forum<br></p><p><b>00:02:31.166 - 00:02:33.933</b><br>you know answering questions and explaining<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.333 - 00:02:37.666</b><br>this system which he calls the millipede system<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.166 - 00:02:40.333</b><br>he calls this building a millipede<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.200 - 00:02:45.666</b><br>and just like me he eventually got a little less active<br></p><p><b>00:02:46.466 - 00:02:47.933</b><br>on his forum or his<br></p><p><b>00:02:48.466 - 00:02:49.500</b><br>blog or whatever<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.300 - 00:02:52.266</b><br>because once<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.066 - 00:02:53.866</b><br>it was pretty<br></p><p><b>00:02:53.866 - 00:02:55.533</b><br>clear what his system was and all the<br></p><p><b>00:02:55.533 - 00:02:56.900</b><br>questions were answered<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.333 - 00:02:58.133</b><br>instead of just<br></p><p><b>00:02:58.133 - 00:03:00.800</b><br>re answering the same questions over and over again<br></p><p><b>00:03:01.333 - 00:03:02.333</b><br>he started to disappear<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.333 - 00:03:03.066</b><br>and then eventually<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.066 - 00:03:05.400</b><br>I don't even think that he posts anymore<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.866 - 00:03:08.800</b><br>all of the information is still there<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.933 - 00:03:09.900</b><br>and that's why<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.066 - 00:03:12.866</b><br>when I came across it and this is years ago<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.600 - 00:03:15.566</b><br>this is probably about five years ago<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.900 - 00:03:19.200</b><br>you know it really piqued my interest and it<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.200 - 00:03:21.066</b><br>kept me up at night thinking about it<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.733 - 00:03:23.900</b><br>so I copied and pasted<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.200 - 00:03:26.566</b><br>everything that he said<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.966 - 00:03:31.266</b><br>in his forum and I put that to a word file and<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.533 - 00:03:34.100</b><br>I stored it I saved it away so that<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.700 - 00:03:37.966</b><br>if at some point they ever take down his forum<br></p><p><b>00:03:38.700 - 00:03:41.066</b><br>I still have the information because it is<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.066 - 00:03:43.666</b><br>pure Genia and I really think I could<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.800 - 00:03:46.166</b><br>follow in his footsteps if I wanted to<br></p><p><b>00:03:46.333 - 00:03:50.266</b><br>it would require that I not trade anything else<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.466 - 00:03:52.200</b><br>and focus solely on<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.533 - 00:03:55.133</b><br>building a millipede like him<br></p><p><b>00:03:55.500 - 00:03:57.066</b><br>but I think that I could do it<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.566 - 00:03:58.766</b><br>and so I thought you know what<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.766 - 00:04:00.400</b><br>I'm going to save this information<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.400 - 00:04:02.166</b><br>and maybe in the future<br></p><p><b>00:04:03.066 - 00:04:03.866</b><br>I might<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.000 - 00:04:07.700</b><br>just take a few months and dedicate my time to<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.300 - 00:04:09.766</b><br>doing exactly what he did<br></p><p><b>00:04:10.800 - 00:04:14.100</b><br>okay so before we get into the meat of his strategy<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.700 - 00:04:16.166</b><br>let's just discuss together<br></p><p><b>00:04:17.333 - 00:04:20.066</b><br>some 4x basics what's different<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.533 - 00:04:25.600</b><br>from 4x compared to the way that we trade now so 4x<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.400 - 00:04:32.200</b><br>so the first major difference is that in 4X<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.266 - 00:04:34.666</b><br>you're using leverage to trade<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.066 - 00:04:36.900</b><br>so that means that you're going to have<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.900 - 00:04:38.366</b><br>margin requirements<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.733 - 00:04:39.600</b><br>so depending on a<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.600 - 00:04:41.266</b><br>brokerage that you choose<br></p><p><b>00:04:41.266 - 00:04:43.400</b><br>they're going to allow you different types of margin<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.566 - 00:04:44.700</b><br>could be 10 to 1<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.700 - 00:04:46.166</b><br>50 to 1 100 to 1<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.166 - 00:04:48.333</b><br>and some of the sketchier brokerages<br></p><p><b>00:04:48.333 - 00:04:50.000</b><br>will even go higher than that 200<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.000 - 00:04:51.533</b><br>300 500 to 1<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.366 - 00:04:54.766</b><br>so you can get some crazy margin out there<br></p><p><b>00:04:55.133 - 00:04:57.800</b><br>basically what leverage means<br></p><p><b>00:04:58.000 - 00:05:00.466</b><br>in in forx or this margin thing<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.800 - 00:05:03.333</b><br>is that for a small amount<br></p><p><b>00:05:03.766 - 00:05:07.133</b><br>of money you can control a large amount of money<br></p><p><b>00:05:07.500 - 00:05:11.333</b><br>so as an example with $5,000 you could control<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.700 - 00:05:14.166</b><br>perhaps $500,000<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.533 - 00:05:16.533</b><br>and this is a two edged sword<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.966 - 00:05:18.000</b><br>that means that<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.066 - 00:05:19.933</b><br>a small move in the market could<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.933 - 00:05:23.300</b><br>easily increase this 500 thousand to you know<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.300 - 00:05:25.066</b><br>500 and 5,000<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.533 - 00:05:27.400</b><br>and you'd be double your account<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.400 - 00:05:29.366</b><br>you will have double your account<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.466 - 00:05:32.000</b><br>but with a small swing backwards<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.133 - 00:05:35.800</b><br>this could easily turn into 495,000<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.000 - 00:05:37.500</b><br>and that's where<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.466 - 00:05:40.933</b><br>your brokerage will just simply<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.600 - 00:05:44.733</b><br>close your account<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.466 - 00:05:48.533</b><br>they never lose any money<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.533 - 00:05:50.533</b><br>they send you a margin call and say<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.700 - 00:05:53.000</b><br>you have to add margin to your account<br></p><p><b>00:05:53.166 - 00:05:55.466</b><br>or we're going to close the position<br></p><p><b>00:05:57.666 - 00:06:00.200</b><br>so basically you don't want to get greedy and take<br></p><p><b>00:06:00.266 - 00:06:01.700</b><br>too much margin<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.666 - 00:06:06.200</b><br>you pick a level that makes sense and and<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.600 - 00:06:08.933</b><br>I'm using 5,000 as example<br></p><p><b>00:06:09.133 - 00:06:13.400</b><br>because Grammy or pipeasy on Forx Factory<br></p><p><b>00:06:13.466 - 00:06:15.933</b><br>the one who we're going to be discussing his system<br></p><p><b>00:06:16.500 - 00:06:18.600</b><br>says that you can easily start<br></p><p><b>00:06:18.700 - 00:06:21.733</b><br>with $5,000 as your startup capital<br></p><p><b>00:06:22.166 - 00:06:24.766</b><br>and be able to successfully do his system<br></p><p><b>00:06:25.666 - 00:06:27.566</b><br>I don't want to make this video too long so<br></p><p><b>00:06:27.600 - 00:06:30.366</b><br>we're not going to go into contracts and lot sizes<br></p><p><b>00:06:30.700 - 00:06:32.600</b><br>and define those you know like<br></p><p><b>00:06:32.733 - 00:06:36.866</b><br>a standard lot size is usually 100,000 units of the<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.600 - 00:06:38.866</b><br>currency that you're trading<br></p><p><b>00:06:38.866 - 00:06:40.400</b><br>but anyway all of that doesn't matter<br></p><p><b>00:06:40.400 - 00:06:42.900</b><br>what you really need as a definition is<br></p><p><b>00:06:43.400 - 00:06:44.800</b><br>to understand pips<br></p><p><b>00:06:45.400 - 00:06:48.266</b><br>so FXCM is the brokerage that<br></p><p><b>00:06:48.733 - 00:06:49.666</b><br>pipeasy<br></p><p><b>00:06:51.400 - 00:06:52.166</b><br>suggests<br></p><p><b>00:06:52.166 - 00:06:52.600</b><br>well<br></p><p><b>00:06:52.600 - 00:06:54.200</b><br>that he uses and that he<br></p><p><b>00:06:54.200 - 00:06:56.900</b><br>suggests that you use to do his<br></p><p><b>00:06:58.200 - 00:06:59.000</b><br>system<br></p><p><b>00:07:00.100 - 00:07:03.400</b><br>and there's a reason behind that is because FXCM<br></p><p><b>00:07:03.533 - 00:07:05.000</b><br>has a way of accounting<br></p><p><b>00:07:05.133 - 00:07:07.533</b><br>that makes the math so much easier<br></p><p><b>00:07:07.566 - 00:07:08.400</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:07:08.400 - 00:07:09.766</b><br>let's just use them right now<br></p><p><b>00:07:09.766 - 00:07:11.933</b><br>to describe what a pip is so that<br></p><p><b>00:07:12.600 - 00:07:14.866</b><br>they'll explain a lot better than I will it's<br></p><p><b>00:07:15.066 - 00:07:15.866</b><br>basically<br></p><p><b>00:07:16.500 - 00:07:17.966</b><br>the furthest decimal point<br></p><p><b>00:07:17.966 - 00:07:19.866</b><br>but anyway let's just listen to them<br></p><p><b>00:07:22.866 - 00:07:26.066</b><br>a pip is typically defined as the smallest<br></p><p><b>00:07:26.066 - 00:07:28.133</b><br>movement an exchange rate can make<br></p><p><b>00:07:28.800 - 00:07:31.466</b><br>most currency pairs like the pound dollar<br></p><p><b>00:07:31.500 - 00:07:33.900</b><br>are quoted to the fourth decimal place<br></p><p><b>00:07:33.900 - 00:07:35.100</b><br>like you see here<br></p><p><b>00:07:35.933 - 00:07:37.166</b><br>let's look at an example<br></p><p><b>00:07:37.166 - 00:07:39.866</b><br>to see what a 1 pip movement would look like<br></p><p><b>00:07:39.866 - 00:07:40.933</b><br>for the pound dollar<br></p><p><b>00:07:42.300 - 00:07:47.400</b><br>assume that the buy price is currently quoted at 1.5863<br></p><p><b>00:07:48.000 - 00:07:51.766</b><br>if the price then changes to 1.5864<br></p><p><b>00:07:52.066 - 00:07:54.133</b><br>that would be an increase of 1 pit<br></p><p><b>00:07:54.900 - 00:08:01.533</b><br>likewise if the price changes from 1.5864 to 1.5863<br></p><p><b>00:08:01.800 - 00:08:04.000</b><br>that would be a decrease of one pit<br></p><p><b>00:08:07.300 - 00:08:09.466</b><br>okay so going back to our chart you can see<br></p><p><b>00:08:10.366 - 00:08:14.700</b><br>the number changing down here so 1 pip would be point<br></p><p><b>00:08:14.933 - 00:08:15.566</b><br>one<br></p><p><b>00:08:15.566 - 00:08:19.533</b><br>four two two and you can see there's an extra<br></p><p><b>00:08:20.966 - 00:08:21.766</b><br>number there<br></p><p><b>00:08:21.966 - 00:08:25.500</b><br>that keeps switching that's a fractional pip and so<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.900 - 00:08:29.000</b><br>with a trading view on these charts<br></p><p><b>00:08:29.666 - 00:08:32.366</b><br>you know they even record the fractional pips<br></p><p><b>00:08:32.500 - 00:08:34.266</b><br>but basically anyway<br></p><p><b>00:08:35.066 - 00:08:37.666</b><br>the fourth decimal place would be your pip<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.733 - 00:08:40.966</b><br>so when you open an account with FXCM<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.200 - 00:08:43.900</b><br>you decide how much margin you want to use<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.966 - 00:08:47.200</b><br>and you decide how big your lot sizes are going to be<br></p><p><b>00:08:47.333 - 00:08:50.300</b><br>and so you can make one pit worth $1<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.066 - 00:08:53.600</b><br>you know so that every time a pip changes you either<br></p><p><b>00:08:53.600 - 00:08:55.700</b><br>you either gain $1 or lose $1<br></p><p><b>00:08:56.133 - 00:08:57.966</b><br>or you can make it worth $10 or<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.966 - 00:08:59.866</b><br>$20 or whatever you decide it to be<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.100 - 00:09:03.566</b><br>but basically for the purpose of this video<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.666 - 00:09:05.600</b><br>let's just say a pip is worth $1<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.500 - 00:09:07.800</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:09:07.800 - 00:09:11.533</b><br>so the next difference between what we trade and forex<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.700 - 00:09:14.300</b><br>would be commissions now how do commissions work<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.933 - 00:09:18.900</b><br>so brokers charge commissions via the spread<br></p><p><b>00:09:19.133 - 00:09:22.066</b><br>the spread is basically the difference between<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.133 - 00:09:23.500</b><br>the bid and the ask<br></p><p><b>00:09:24.666 - 00:09:26.800</b><br>okay so let's go back to FXCM for<br></p><p><b>00:09:26.800 - 00:09:29.333</b><br>a little bit of the definition on spread<br></p><p><b>00:09:30.400 - 00:09:32.766</b><br>so here's what they're saying<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.066 - 00:09:34.466</b><br>that there's a fixed commission<br></p><p><b>00:09:34.466 - 00:09:36.000</b><br>which is the difference between<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.000 - 00:09:36.600</b><br>the bit and the<br></p><p><b>00:09:36.600 - 00:09:38.966</b><br>ass so with a fixed commission for example<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.066 - 00:09:41.600</b><br>if the bit and the ass prices on the Euro USD<br></p><p><b>00:09:41.600 - 00:09:44.533</b><br>which is the chart that we're gonna be looking at is<br></p><p><b>00:09:44.900 - 00:09:47.166</b><br>1.2576<br></p><p><b>00:09:47.166 - 00:09:49.500</b><br>and 1.2578<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.866 - 00:09:53.200</b><br>then the trader can buy the currency at the 78 price<br></p><p><b>00:09:53.266 - 00:09:56.200</b><br>and sell it back to the dealer at the 76 price<br></p><p><b>00:09:56.566 - 00:09:59.933</b><br>so that's you know like 2 pips spread<br></p><p><b>00:10:00.200 - 00:10:02.400</b><br>that is in the favor of the dealer so because<br></p><p><b>00:10:02.466 - 00:10:04.733</b><br>FXCM is making the market<br></p><p><b>00:10:05.300 - 00:10:07.533</b><br>and they're receiving hundreds of orders back<br></p><p><b>00:10:07.533 - 00:10:09.400</b><br>and forth back and forth back and forth<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.666 - 00:10:11.700</b><br>they're just making that difference of the spread<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.700 - 00:10:12.966</b><br>they're selling some<br></p><p><b>00:10:13.133 - 00:10:16.466</b><br>and buying some and selling some and buying some<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.533 - 00:10:19.200</b><br>and they end up making that 2 pip spread<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.333 - 00:10:20.133</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:10:20.700 - 00:10:22.933</b><br>that way it's basically<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.733 - 00:10:25.866</b><br>like you don't have to think about commissions<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.900 - 00:10:27.800</b><br>the only thing that would concern you as far as<br></p><p><b>00:10:27.800 - 00:10:29.200</b><br>commissions goes<br></p><p><b>00:10:29.200 - 00:10:31.133</b><br>is that you wouldn't want to be with a broker<br></p><p><b>00:10:31.133 - 00:10:33.100</b><br>that has a very wide spread<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.333 - 00:10:35.700</b><br>you want to be with a broker that has a very<br></p><p><b>00:10:35.700 - 00:10:36.700</b><br>narrow spread<br></p><p><b>00:10:36.700 - 00:10:38.900</b><br>because the minute you put on a trade<br></p><p><b>00:10:39.100 - 00:10:41.800</b><br>you're effectively two pips in the hole<br></p><p><b>00:10:41.966 - 00:10:43.866</b><br>because if like two seconds later<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.866 - 00:10:45.566</b><br>you decide oh wait I did that wrong<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.566 - 00:10:46.666</b><br>I want to change that<br></p><p><b>00:10:46.666 - 00:10:47.700</b><br>I want to sell<br></p><p><b>00:10:48.500 - 00:10:50.066</b><br>that trade that I just opened<br></p><p><b>00:10:50.966 - 00:10:51.700</b><br>you'd have to<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.700 - 00:10:55.566</b><br>you'd have to sell two pips into the hole and you okay<br></p><p><b>00:10:55.566 - 00:10:58.000</b><br>so now that we covered what leverage is that<br></p><p><b>00:10:58.000 - 00:10:59.800</b><br>you're using a small amount of money to control<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.800 - 00:11:00.900</b><br>a big amount of minority<br></p><p><b>00:11:01.100 - 00:11:04.066</b><br>now that we talked about that you're<br></p><p><b>00:11:04.200 - 00:11:06.900</b><br>basically effectively buying contracts<br></p><p><b>00:11:07.133 - 00:11:09.900</b><br>and that you can decide on<br></p><p><b>00:11:09.900 - 00:11:11.566</b><br>how much one pip is worth<br></p><p><b>00:11:11.566 - 00:11:14.266</b><br>and now you know what a pip is then<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.266 - 00:11:15.733</b><br>and we've also looked at commissions<br></p><p><b>00:11:15.733 - 00:11:16.166</b><br>that really<br></p><p><b>00:11:16.166 - 00:11:17.866</b><br>were just dealing with the spread between the<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.866 - 00:11:18.500</b><br>bid and the ask<br></p><p><b>00:11:18.500 - 00:11:20.166</b><br>and so there's no actual<br></p><p><b>00:11:20.300 - 00:11:22.200</b><br>you're paying a percentage<br></p><p><b>00:11:22.566 - 00:11:23.700</b><br>for commissions<br></p><p><b>00:11:23.933 - 00:11:25.266</b><br>now that we've covered all of that<br></p><p><b>00:11:26.066 - 00:11:28.700</b><br>y FXCM why does Pipez<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.500 - 00:11:33.300</b><br>tell us that we should be using that broker in specific<br></p><p><b>00:11:35.966 - 00:11:37.133</b><br>so y FXM well<br></p><p><b>00:11:37.133 - 00:11:38.966</b><br>let's look at the chart and I'll try to<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.966 - 00:11:40.333</b><br>explain it on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:11:41.733 - 00:11:44.466</b><br>it all comes down to how they do their accounting<br></p><p><b>00:11:45.200 - 00:11:46.566</b><br>so let's scroll in<br></p><p><b>00:11:46.733 - 00:11:48.133</b><br>a little closer to this<br></p><p><b>00:11:48.200 - 00:11:49.566</b><br>Euro USD chart<br></p><p><b>00:11:49.566 - 00:11:52.666</b><br>and let's imagine that this was a cryptochart<br></p><p><b>00:11:53.066 - 00:11:53.900</b><br>and so<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.566 - 00:11:57.533</b><br>let's say we were trading our normal position<br></p><p><b>00:11:57.533 - 00:11:59.600</b><br>size way of trading right<br></p><p><b>00:11:59.600 - 00:12:01.300</b><br>so let's say we were going to call<br></p><p><b>00:12:01.300 - 00:12:02.733</b><br>this a base right here<br></p><p><b>00:12:03.966 - 00:12:06.000</b><br>let's say we were going to call this a base<br></p><p><b>00:12:06.266 - 00:12:08.366</b><br>and we call this a panic<br></p><p><b>00:12:09.133 - 00:12:11.600</b><br>and maybe we call even this a base over here too<br></p><p><b>00:12:12.566 - 00:12:14.700</b><br>so this is now what we're familiar with<br></p><p><b>00:12:14.800 - 00:12:16.366</b><br>we'd probably go along<br></p><p><b>00:12:16.766 - 00:12:18.500</b><br>maybe over here with a nibble<br></p><p><b>00:12:18.800 - 00:12:20.966</b><br>and maybe we take another nibble over here<br></p><p><b>00:12:21.100 - 00:12:22.200</b><br>and then because it just<br></p><p><b>00:12:22.200 - 00:12:24.066</b><br>crossed another vase completely<br></p><p><b>00:12:24.133 - 00:12:26.166</b><br>we'd probably start to go a little heavier here<br></p><p><b>00:12:26.366 - 00:12:28.166</b><br>and maybe a little bit more here and see<br></p><p><b>00:12:28.166 - 00:12:29.566</b><br>so we're layering in<br></p><p><b>00:12:30.100 - 00:12:32.300</b><br>and what's happening<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.466 - 00:12:32.800</b><br>after<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.800 - 00:12:35.800</b><br>all this is said and done is we end up with an average<br></p><p><b>00:12:35.800 - 00:12:36.700</b><br>price<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.866 - 00:12:37.800</b><br>of maybe<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.566 - 00:12:39.366</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:12:39.866 - 00:12:43.000</b><br>you know because these were small and these were bigger<br></p><p><b>00:12:43.133 - 00:12:45.266</b><br>we end up with an average price right there<br></p><p><b>00:12:45.366 - 00:12:49.666</b><br>and then we get the bounce right back up to our base<br></p><p><b>00:12:50.766 - 00:12:53.766</b><br>we have this whole section over here that's profit<br></p><p><b>00:12:53.900 - 00:12:55.366</b><br>right so<br></p><p><b>00:12:55.966 - 00:12:58.066</b><br>well we are dealing with currency<br></p><p><b>00:12:58.066 - 00:13:00.600</b><br>and so you can't really say this is a safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:13:00.600 - 00:13:03.733</b><br>here's a base here's a safe circle<br></p><p><b>00:13:04.133 - 00:13:06.066</b><br>well it will mainly work<br></p><p><b>00:13:06.400 - 00:13:10.166</b><br>it is 4x and so sometimes it won't work<br></p><p><b>00:13:10.166 - 00:13:12.400</b><br>sometimes you will put a base like that<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.666 - 00:13:14.700</b><br>and you'd call your save circle<br></p><p><b>00:13:14.700 - 00:13:16.300</b><br>and it just keeps on going lower<br></p><p><b>00:13:16.300 - 00:13:17.466</b><br>and it doesn't come back<br></p><p><b>00:13:18.066 - 00:13:19.866</b><br>and that's because it's a different market<br></p><p><b>00:13:19.866 - 00:13:23.000</b><br>it's not as easy as our market<br></p><p><b>00:13:23.733 - 00:13:24.533</b><br>but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:13:25.933 - 00:13:27.166</b><br>oh just a second<br></p><p><b>00:13:28.533 - 00:13:30.733</b><br>sorry about that please bear in mind that I'm treating<br></p><p><b>00:13:30.733 -

00:15:33.266</b><br>as we start to look at his system<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.966 - 00:15:35.966</b><br>you really need a broker<br></p><p><b>00:15:36.333 - 00:15:38.266</b><br>that if you want to make the math easy<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.366 - 00:15:40.800</b><br>you need a broker that accounts<br></p><p><b>00:15:40.800 - 00:15:42.533</b><br>that does its bookkeeping this way<br></p><p><b>00:15:44.166 - 00:15:45.533</b><br>okay so let's think about<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.566 - 00:15:47.900</b><br>what this bookkeeping really does for us<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.466 - 00:15:52.166</b><br>now imagine you wanted to take a long position<br></p><p><b>00:15:52.533 - 00:15:53.500</b><br>right here<br></p><p><b>00:15:53.766 - 00:15:56.200</b><br>and at the exact same time you wanted to take a<br></p><p><b>00:15:56.200 - 00:15:57.266</b><br>short position<br></p><p><b>00:15:57.266 - 00:15:58.066</b><br>right there<br></p><p><b>00:15:58.766 - 00:16:01.200</b><br>well with this type of bookkeeping you could do that<br></p><p><b>00:16:01.500 - 00:16:03.800</b><br>you could go along the market right here<br></p><p><b>00:16:04.333 - 00:16:04.966</b><br>and you could<br></p><p><b>00:16:04.966 - 00:16:06.300</b><br>short the market right here and<br></p><p><b>00:16:06.300 - 00:16:08.333</b><br>effectively have two positions<br></p><p><b>00:16:09.200 - 00:16:10.000</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:16:10.466 - 00:16:12.666</b><br>when this price goes down and you get down to<br></p><p><b>00:16:12.666 - 00:16:14.166</b><br>let's say right here<br></p><p><b>00:16:14.966 - 00:16:17.566</b><br>if you wanted to close these positions<br></p><p><b>00:16:17.933 - 00:16:19.900</b><br>you could you would you would<br></p><p><b>00:16:19.933 - 00:16:22.400</b><br>make a whole bunch you would make this much<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.533 - 00:16:24.133</b><br>off of that position<br></p><p><b>00:16:24.600 - 00:16:27.900</b><br>and you would lose this much off of that position<br></p><p><b>00:16:27.900 - 00:16:29.400</b><br>and come out net equal<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.566 - 00:16:30.333</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:16:30.333 - 00:16:31.933</b><br>one loss would cover<br></p><p><b>00:16:32.133 - 00:16:32.933</b><br>the game<br></p><p><b>00:16:33.066 - 00:16:34.933</b><br>and you would end up break even<br></p><p><b>00:16:35.066 - 00:16:36.700</b><br>so basically you did nothing<br></p><p><b>00:16:36.700 - 00:16:38.466</b><br>by taking these two positions<br></p><p><b>00:16:38.466 - 00:16:39.766</b><br>so what is the advantage of having<br></p><p><b>00:16:39.766 - 00:16:41.800</b><br>each trade act independently<br></p><p><b>00:16:41.800 - 00:16:43.200</b><br>so you go short here<br></p><p><b>00:16:43.766 - 00:16:47.466</b><br>it comes down and then you can either close this short<br></p><p><b>00:16:47.733 - 00:16:49.533</b><br>or you can go long here<br></p><p><b>00:16:49.533 - 00:16:52.266</b><br>a brand new position and this short is still running<br></p><p><b>00:16:52.700 - 00:16:55.466</b><br>and now you're long here a brand new position<br></p><p><b>00:16:55.733 - 00:16:57.533</b><br>and it keeps going down further<br></p><p><b>00:16:57.600 - 00:17:00.400</b><br>and now you can either again close this long<br></p><p><b>00:17:01.266 - 00:17:04.566</b><br>close this short or just take a brand new long again<br></p><p><b>00:17:05.066 - 00:17:06.766</b><br>so what is the advantage of that<br></p><p><b>00:17:07.200 - 00:17:10.866</b><br>to having two positions open instead of just closing<br></p><p><b>00:17:12.466 - 00:17:15.400</b><br>man I wish I still had an FXCM account<br></p><p><b>00:17:15.400 - 00:17:16.933</b><br>so that I could show you how this looks<br></p><p><b>00:17:16.933 - 00:17:18.266</b><br>on the account page<br></p><p><b>00:17:19.666 - 00:17:20.466</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:17:20.566 - 00:17:24.400</b><br>on my positions page but here I just drew up a<br></p><p><b>00:17:25.666 - 00:17:26.800</b><br>mock up version<br></p><p><b>00:17:26.933 - 00:17:28.766</b><br>so basically you'd have<br></p><p><b>00:17:29.100 - 00:17:32.133</b><br>a bunch of lines with all your positions<br></p><p><b>00:17:32.533 - 00:17:36.733</b><br>and you could be you know long at 106 let's say<br></p><p><b>00:17:37.000 - 00:17:40.566</b><br>and short at 10108 and<br></p><p><b>00:17:41.200 - 00:17:42.966</b><br>long again at 109<br></p><p><b>00:17:43.166 - 00:17:43.900</b><br>and this<br></p><p><b>00:17:43.900 - 00:17:48.366</b><br>this position could be in the hole $70<br></p><p><b>00:17:48.600 - 00:17:50.500</b><br>could be negative $70 and this one could be<br></p><p><b>00:17:50.500 - 00:17:52.666</b><br>plus one 30 and this could be plus<br></p><p><b>00:17:52.800 - 00:17:54.900</b><br>one 10 all at the same time<br></p><p><b>00:17:55.300 -

00:18:04.166</b><br>that your margin will allow you to<br></p><p><b>00:18:05.333 - 00:18:08.000</b><br>and then close them whenever you want<br></p><p><b>00:18:08.000 - 00:18:12.366</b><br>so right now in this positions page on FXCM<br></p><p><b>00:18:12.366 - 00:18:13.800</b><br>you could click on this<br></p><p><b>00:18:14.100 - 00:18:15.266</b><br>position line<br></p><p><b>00:18:15.666 - 00:18:17.400</b><br>and you could say I'd like to close<br></p><p><b>00:18:17.400 - 00:18:19.966</b><br>this position at such and such a price so<br></p><p><b>00:18:20.066 - 00:18:23.066</b><br>I'm long 106 I'd like to close this position<br></p><p><b>00:18:23.366 - 00:18:25.866</b><br>at I don't know 1075<br></p><p><b>00:18:26.600 - 00:18:28.333</b><br>so you just click on it<br></p><p><b>00:18:28.366 - 00:18:29.266</b><br>left click on it<br></p><p><b>00:18:29.266 - 00:18:31.800</b><br>and a little box pops up and you say I want to close<br></p><p><b>00:18:31.800 -

00:18:50.333</b><br>so the problem is<br></p><p><b>00:18:50.333 - 00:18:52.266</b><br>obviously that we cannot predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:18:52.366 - 00:18:54.333</b><br>you know that every trader would love<br></p><p><b>00:18:54.333 -

00:19:23.900</b><br>how do you avoid that<br></p><p><b>00:19:23.900 - 00:19:25.966</b><br>and how do you make these perfect traits<br></p><p><b>00:19:25.966 - 00:19:27.400</b><br>that's the problem<br></p><p><b>00:19:27.500 -

00:20:50.566</b><br>or any stock<br></p><p><b>00:20:50.600 - 00:20:53.200</b><br>and just be in the know before everybody else<br></p><p><b>00:20:53.200 - 00:20:54.400</b><br>that's a great solution<br></p><p><b>00:20:54.400 - 00:20:55.900</b><br>to predicting the future<br></p><p><b>00:20:56.100 - 00:20:58.700</b><br>so another solution would be to use technology<br></p><p><b>00:20:58.800 - 00:21:00.566</b><br>to give yourself an inch to<br></p><p><b>00:21:00.600 - 00:21:03.366</b><br>either have faster execution a platform that's<br></p><p><b>00:21:03.466 - 00:21:05.100</b><br>faster than everybody else<br></p><p><b>00:21:05.266 - 00:21:08.866</b><br>or to use some form of trading bots or algorithm<br></p><p><b>00:21:08.933 - 00:21:09.766</b><br>to be able to<br></p><p><b>00:21:09.766 - 00:21:12.133</b><br>trade for you faster than a human can trade<br></p><p><b>00:21:12.366 - 00:21:15.100</b><br>or maybe even just try to make very small<br></p><p><b>00:21:15.166 - 00:21:17.600</b><br>trades where you're taking just a few pennies on every<br></p><p><b>00:21:17.600 - 00:21:18.366</b><br>trade<br></p><p><b>00:21:18.366 - 00:21:21.866</b><br>really fast with your execution so using technology<br></p><p><b>00:21:22.300 - 00:21:24.266</b><br>using technology probably also would<br></p><p><b>00:21:24.366 - 00:21:25.900</b><br>work for me with<br></p><p><b>00:21:25.966 - 00:21:28.533</b><br>all my scanners and stuff trying to find<br></p><p><b>00:21:28.666 - 00:21:30.700</b><br>movements in the market faster than anybody<br></p><p><b>00:21:30.700 - 00:21:31.666</b><br>else can see them<br></p><p><b>00:21:32.000 - 00:21:34.200</b><br>so using technology is one way<br></p><p><b>00:21:34.366 - 00:21:36.600</b><br>of not necessarily predicting the future<br></p><p><b>00:21:36.600 - 00:21:39.900</b><br>but being able to react faster than anybody else<br></p><p><b>00:21:40.300 - 00:21:42.533</b><br>and then finally the theme of our video<br></p><p><b>00:21:43.166 - 00:21:45.100</b><br>using a mathematical system<br></p><p><b>00:21:45.800 - 00:21:47.966</b><br>looking at risk and reward ratios<br></p><p><b>00:21:47.966 - 00:21:49.900</b><br>looking at statistical analysis<br></p><p><b>00:21:49.900 - 00:21:51.666</b><br>and putting the odds in your favor<br></p><p><b>00:21:51.733 - 00:21:54.366</b><br>so this is the one that I like the best<br></p><p><b>00:21:54.966 - 00:21:56.933</b><br>and this is the one that works on pretty well<br></p><p><b>00:21:56.933 - 00:21:59.066</b><br>any market and<br></p><p><b>00:21:59.300 - 00:22:02.166</b><br>this is the one that most people go after<br></p><p><b>00:22:02.300 - 00:22:03.800</b><br>trying to figure out a way<br></p><p><b>00:22:04.066 - 00:22:05.400</b><br>to beat the market<br></p><p><b>00:22:06.000 - 00:22:08.166</b><br>usually with a mathematical system<br></p><p><b>00:22:08.566 - 00:22:11.300</b><br>you're no longer trying to predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:22:11.300 - 00:22:12.066</b><br>so although<br></p><p><b>00:22:12.066 - 00:22:14.366</b><br>we cannot predict the future is the problem<br></p><p><b>00:22:15.266 - 00:22:16.700</b><br>a mathematical system<br></p><p><b>00:22:17.866 - 00:22:20.300</b><br>subverts that or goes beyond that<br></p><p><b>00:22:20.300 - 00:22:22.966</b><br>and instead of trying to predict the future<br></p><p><b>00:22:23.266 - 00:22:24.333</b><br>it just figures<br></p><p><b>00:22:24.366 - 00:22:26.300</b><br>out a way that no matter what<br></p><p><b>00:22:26.966 - 00:22:29.933</b><br>happens whether the market goes up or goes down<br></p><p><b>00:22:30.000 - 00:22:31.966</b><br>you always end up winning<br></p><p><b>00:22:32.066 - 00:22:32.866</b><br>in the end<br></p><p><b>00:22:34.066 - 00:22:36.300</b><br>so I'm sure you guys may be able to come up with a<br></p><p><b>00:22:36.300 - 00:22:38.366</b><br>few more ideas on how<br></p><p><b>00:22:38.966 - 00:22:40.900</b><br>people are solving this problem on<br></p><p><b>00:22:40.933 - 00:22:42.600</b><br>different ways that people trade<br></p><p><b>00:22:42.866 - 00:22:43.800</b><br>other than just<br></p><p><b>00:22:43.800 - 00:22:44.900</b><br>my few that I got here<br></p><p><b>00:22:44.900 - 00:22:47.000</b><br>but let's focus on the mathematical system<br></p><p><b>00:22:47.000 - 00:22:48.533</b><br>because that's what we're dealing with<br></p><p><b>00:22:49.133 - 00:22:50.766</b><br>with this system that we're looking at<br></p><p><b>00:22:51.400 - 00:22:52.900</b><br>okay guys we're almost at<br></p><p><b>00:22:52.900 - 00:22:53.766</b><br>23 minutes<br></p><p><b>00:22:53.766 - 00:22:56.200</b><br>and I'm not sure what my limits are on these videos<br></p><p><b>00:22:56.266 - 00:22:58.100</b><br>so I'm gonna stop the video here<br></p><p><b>00:22:58.300 - 00:23:00.266</b><br>and make a part 3<br></p><p><b>00:23:00.266 - 00:23:02.466</b><br>I guess I was only playing to do part one and part 2<br></p><p><b>00:23:02.466 - 00:23:03.600</b><br>but we'll make a part 3<br></p><p><b>00:23:03.866 - 00:23:06.066</b><br>so please continue into part 3<br></p><p><b>00:23:06.133 - 00:23:08.466</b><br>so that you can see the entire strategy<br></p></body></html>
