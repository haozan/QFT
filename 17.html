00:00:04.966</b><br>so I don't really have very much time for video<br></p><p><b>00:00:04.966 - 00:00:06.066</b><br>but I think that<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.400 - 00:00:07.600</b><br>it's important that we talk<br></p><p><b>00:00:07.600 - 00:00:09.966</b><br>about what's about to have in a bitcoin with this fork<br></p><p><b>00:00:10.533 - 00:00:11.733</b><br>so that you're prepared<br></p><p><b>00:00:11.866 - 00:00:13.533</b><br>and I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.366 - 00:00:15.133</b><br>because<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.133 - 00:00:18.200</b><br>according to Bitrex here's the statement from Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:00:18.766 - 00:00:23.300</b><br>bitcoin should fork on August 1st at 5 20 a<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.300 - 00:00:25.366</b><br>m so I'm going to be setting my alarm<br></p><p><b>00:00:25.366 - 00:00:26.666</b><br>and I will be awake<br></p><p><b>00:00:27.000 - 00:00:28.500</b><br>tomorrow morning very early<br></p><p><b>00:00:28.500 - 00:00:30.200</b><br>so I'm ready for what's about to happen<br></p><p><b>00:00:31.166 - 00:00:32.666</b><br>this could get very crazy<br></p><p><b>00:00:33.266 - 00:00:37.500</b><br>so according to this statement from Bitrex if you have<br></p><p><b>00:00:37.700 - 00:00:39.266</b><br>your Bitcoin at Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:00:39.266 - 00:00:40.900</b><br>then they're gonna give you one for one<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.900 - 00:00:42.733</b><br>they're gonna support the coin<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.933 - 00:00:44.666</b><br>so if you have Bitcoin there<br></p><p><b>00:00:44.666 - 00:00:46.500</b><br>you're gonna also have Bitcoin cash<br></p><p><b>00:00:46.666 - 00:00:48.566</b><br>and then they are going to<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.200 - 00:00:51.200</b><br>possibly allow trading on it<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.300 - 00:00:54.166</b><br>depending on how much stability there is in the market<br></p><p><b>00:00:54.933 - 00:00:56.066</b><br>so I don't know what that means<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.066 - 00:00:56.900</b><br>I don't know if we're gonna be<br></p><p><b>00:00:56.900 - 00:00:58.466</b><br>able to just immediately take<br></p><p><b>00:00:59.000 - 00:01:00.966</b><br>our bitcoin cache and switch it over<br></p><p><b>00:01:01.000 - 00:01:02.500</b><br>to bitcoin or<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.500 - 00:01:05.266</b><br>you know or trade out of it or whatnot but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.966 - 00:01:09.066</b><br>that's neither here nor there let's talk about<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.766 - 00:01:10.533</b><br>what's actually<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.533 - 00:01:12.666</b><br>happening on the market and how I'm going to trade this<br></p><p><b>00:01:12.666 - 00:01:13.066</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:13.066 - 00:01:15.766</b><br>let me just pause the video and I'll go find the chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.566 - 00:01:17.533</b><br>okay so here's<br></p><p><b>00:01:17.600 - 00:01:18.966</b><br>a chart of BTC<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.000 - 00:01:21.866</b><br>on Vitrex and if you're looking at a chart like this<br></p><p><b>00:01:21.866 - 00:01:23.566</b><br>you're looking at the wrong chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:24.000 - 00:01:26.466</b><br>and can anybody guess what I'm going to say<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.466 - 00:01:27.366</b><br>you're looking at the wrong chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:27.366 - 00:01:28.366</b><br>because I get this question<br></p><p><b>00:01:28.600 - 00:01:29.766</b><br>steady on my blog<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.966 - 00:01:32.666</b><br>it's because you're looking at a two week chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:32.666 - 00:01:34.966</b><br>and you need to be looking at a one month or a<br></p><p><b>00:01:34.966 - 00:01:35.900</b><br>two month chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.133 - 00:01:39.766</b><br>especially with huge news like Bitcoin might fork<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.866 - 00:01:41.733</b><br>that could make a huge move<br></p><p><b>00:01:41.733 - 00:01:44.066</b><br>and so you have to be ready for that<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.366 - 00:01:45.166</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:45.666 - 00:01:47.100</b><br>if you're going to start drawing your bases<br></p><p><b>00:01:47.100 - 00:01:49.400</b><br>you got to be looking at a chart this size<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.400 - 00:01:52.966</b><br>and then you can obviously obviously see your bases<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.766 - 00:01:55.000</b><br>sorry this is the wrong color<br></p><p><b>00:01:56.000 - 00:02:00.733</b><br>yeah so like obvious bass obvious bass obvious bass<br></p><p><b>00:02:00.800 - 00:02:03.700</b><br>obvious bass and so forth and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:02:03.700 - 00:02:04.500</b><br>this one<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.400 - 00:02:06.866</b><br>less obvious but it's there<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.000 - 00:02:07.966</b><br>and then this one<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.133 - 00:02:10.400</b><br>so really our bases are 24<br></p><p><b>00:02:10.600 - 00:02:13.933</b><br>22 and 18 those are the bases that matter<br></p><p><b>00:02:14.000 - 00:02:16.800</b><br>if you scroll in this is not matter<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.066 - 00:02:18.900</b><br>this is not one that matters<br></p><p><b>00:02:19.900 - 00:02:22.533</b><br>this is not one that matters and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.366 - 00:02:25.266</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.900 - 00:02:29.566</b><br>24 22<br></p><p><b>00:02:29.700 - 00:02:32.366</b><br>okay so what is it that I think is going to happen<br></p><p><b>00:02:32.400 - 00:02:34.166</b><br>let's talk about that for a second<br></p><p><b>00:02:34.800 - 00:02:37.766</b><br>so why is the price let's just get rid of all this<br></p><p><b>00:02:38.066 - 00:02:40.466</b><br>why is the price up at 27<br></p><p><b>00:02:40.466 - 00:02:42.000</b><br>so let's think about that together<br></p><p><b>00:02:42.500 - 00:02:46.166</b><br>why with all the danger that's about to happen<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.300 - 00:02:49.400</b><br>in like 18 hours from now<br></p><p><b>00:02:49.566 - 00:02:51.866</b><br>why is everybody not panicking out of their<br></p><p><b>00:02:52.200 - 00:02:53.366</b><br>out of their coin<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.666 - 00:02:57.333</b><br>because they all want the free coin<br></p><p><b>00:02:57.966 - 00:03:00.166</b><br>this is very simplistic<br></p><p><b>00:03:00.500 - 00:03:02.900</b><br>way of thinking but this is how people think<br></p><p><b>00:03:03.666 - 00:03:05.333</b><br>they want that free coin<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.333 - 00:03:06.766</b><br>they think that's going to be worth something<br></p><p><b>00:03:06.766 - 00:03:07.566</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.266 - 00:03:10.400</b><br>in their minds they're thinking<br></p><p><b>00:03:10.500 - 00:03:13.000</b><br>I'm holding this until the very last second<br></p><p><b>00:03:13.000 - 00:03:16.466</b><br>once I get my bitcoin cash<br></p><p><b>00:03:16.600 - 00:03:19.133</b><br>then I'm going to get out and get into cash<br></p><p><b>00:03:19.400 - 00:03:21.066</b><br>so for right now<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.066 - 00:03:24.066</b><br>everybody's holding it and people are even<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.200 - 00:03:25.733</b><br>last minute buying it<br></p><p><b>00:03:26.300 - 00:03:28.866</b><br>so if people are last minute buying it<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.866 - 00:03:30.466</b><br>what typically might happen<br></p><p><b>00:03:30.500 - 00:03:31.766</b><br>let me just move this over<br></p><p><b>00:03:33.200 - 00:03:35.200</b><br>and let me pick another color again<br></p><p><b>00:03:37.333 - 00:03:39.166</b><br>let's go red<br></p><p><b>00:03:40.133 - 00:03:41.500</b><br>so what typically might happen<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.500 - 00:03:43.400</b><br>is we might still see some buying<br></p><p><b>00:03:43.533 - 00:03:45.500</b><br>coming up all the way<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.500 - 00:03:45.866</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:03:45.866 - 00:03:48.733</b><br>maybe a little bit of consolidation and some buying<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.733 - 00:03:50.000</b><br>all the way up until<br></p><p><b>00:03:50.600 - 00:03:52.300</b><br>until the time when it forks<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.300 - 00:03:53.333</b><br>and then there's going to be<br></p><p><b>00:03:53.333 - 00:03:55.333</b><br>some people who are really fast<br></p><p><b>00:03:56.466 - 00:03:57.666</b><br>at that fourth time<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.866 - 00:03:59.766</b><br>and they're going to be the ones who first<br></p><p><b>00:03:59.766 - 00:04:02.066</b><br>try to turn their bitcoin into cash<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.366 - 00:04:05.733</b><br>the market doesn't like few<br></p><p><b>00:04:06.000 - 00:04:08.266</b><br>the market doesn't like uncertainty<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.366 - 00:04:13.933</b><br>so people are wanting to be in a safe coin or in cash<br></p><p><b>00:04:14.700 - 00:04:16.066</b><br>as fast as they can<br></p><p><b>00:04:16.366 - 00:04:18.333</b><br>when they see that there's going to be a problem<br></p><p><b>00:04:18.600 - 00:04:21.966</b><br>so this could create a huge panic rate here<br></p><p><b>00:04:22.133 - 00:04:23.133</b><br>and that would be<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.133 - 00:04:24.533</b><br>you know first thing in the morning<br></p><p><b>00:04:24.533 - 00:04:25.566</b><br>that's why I'll be up<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.333 - 00:04:28.766</b><br>and then we already have our bases figured out<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.766 - 00:04:31.066</b><br>you go back to this<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.666 - 00:04:33.266</b><br>so we already have that 18<br></p><p><b>00:04:33.266 - 00:04:35.866</b><br>base figured out and we have that 22 base figured out<br></p><p><b>00:04:35.866 - 00:04:37.666</b><br>and we have that 24 base figured out<br></p><p><b>00:04:38.600 - 00:04:39.400</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:04:42.866 - 00:04:44.200</b><br>so this thing could<br></p><p><b>00:04:44.933 - 00:04:48.666</b><br>easily easily take a massive massive dump<br></p><p><b>00:04:50.700 - 00:04:53.866</b><br>because it's like a roller coaster and everybody<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.300 - 00:04:56.900</b><br>it's like a domino effect that happens<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.966 - 00:05:00.366</b><br>everybody a few people start selling out their<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.533 - 00:05:02.000</b><br>bitcoin as fast as they can<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.300 - 00:05:05.200</b><br>this validates for everybody else that oh<br></p><p><b>00:05:05.200 - 00:05:06.266</b><br>this could be a crash<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.266 - 00:05:08.066</b><br>I got to get myself to cash<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.300 - 00:05:10.200</b><br>they all start selling off their bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:05:10.300 - 00:05:12.666</b><br>and then it just dominos and dominos and dominos<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.666 - 00:05:14.566</b><br>and it starts passing these bases<br></p><p><b>00:05:14.666 - 00:05:17.600</b><br>and when it passes these bases then bases are<br></p><p><b>00:05:18.100 - 00:05:20.133</b><br>especially with bitcoin are respected<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.366 - 00:05:22.500</b><br>so when it cracks this 24<br></p><p><b>00:05:22.766 - 00:05:25.666</b><br>you might get a quick quick crack and a quick<br></p><p><b>00:05:25.666 - 00:05:27.733</b><br>quick bounce right back up to 24<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.866 - 00:05:29.533</b><br>so this is a scary place<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.733 - 00:05:34.100</b><br>I would buy if this falls really hard really fast<br></p><p><b>00:05:34.166 - 00:05:36.600</b><br>I would buy 23 22<br></p><p><b>00:05:36.600 - 00:05:39.800</b><br>I would buy all underneath this 24 as fast as I can<br></p><p><b>00:05:40.100 - 00:05:44.333</b><br>and immediately put myself back towards 24 so that<br></p><p><b>00:05:44.700 - 00:05:48.000</b><br>that spike back up to the base I can catch it<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.200 - 00:05:50.333</b><br>because this is all going to happen extremely fast<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.333 - 00:05:54.500</b><br>and this is not for new traders to be dealing with<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.500 - 00:05:57.533</b><br>if you're a new trader focus buying under 18<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.133 - 00:06:01.166</b><br>so if this thing falls really really hard<br></p><p><b>00:06:02.500 - 00:06:03.600</b><br>then you know<br></p><p><b>00:06:03.600 - 00:06:03.966</b><br>you can<br></p><p><b>00:06:03.966 - 00:06:06.600</b><br>participate in if you're there and you're on the ball<br></p><p><b>00:06:06.600 - 00:06:08.566</b><br>and you can quickly make your orders<br></p><p><b>00:06:08.733 - 00:06:11.966</b><br>otherwise expect that if this thing falls under 18<br></p><p><b>00:06:12.166 - 00:06:14.166</b><br>that's where you're going to be safe<br></p><p><b>00:06:14.166 - 00:06:17.133</b><br>everything under 18 if you scroll back in time<br></p><p><b>00:06:19.466 - 00:06:21.133</b><br>I don't know why my thing doesn't want to<br></p><p><b>00:06:21.133 - 00:06:22.600</b><br>let me scroll any further<br></p><p><b>00:06:22.966 - 00:06:23.866</b><br>let me pause the video<br></p><p><b>00:06:23.866 - 00:06:25.666</b><br>I'll see if I can get this thing to scroll<br></p><p><b>00:06:26.333 - 00:06:30.333</b><br>okay so I had to take my chart out to a four hour chart<br></p><p><b>00:06:30.900 - 00:06:33.466</b><br>to a four hour chart in order to get us to really<br></p><p><b>00:06:33.466 - 00:06:34.966</b><br>see the full picture here<br></p><p><b>00:06:35.933 - 00:06:37.133</b><br>but you can see that<br></p><p><b>00:06:37.133 - 00:06:39.933</b><br>you know obviously there's been panics in the past<br></p><p><b>00:06:40.666 -

00:08:25.133</b><br>but if you believe in bitcoin if you believe in<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.133 - 00:08:26.333</b><br>cryptocurrencies<br></p><p><b>00:08:26.866 - 00:08:28.400</b><br>anything under 15<br></p><p><b>00:08:28.933 -

00:08:35.666</b><br>load up under 18<br></p><p><b>00:08:35.666 - 00:08:37.500</b><br>if this thing ever cracks that<br></p><p><b>00:08:38.333 - 00:08:40.800</b><br>I mean I think that if it cracks under<br></p><p><b>00:08:41.133 - 00:08:43.733</b><br>under 15 it would be a spike down<br></p><p><b>00:08:44.133 - 00:08:46.133</b><br>and that's another thing we should talk about<br></p><p><b>00:08:46.800 - 00:08:48.266</b><br>like these spike downs<br></p><p><b>00:08:48.366 - 00:08:51.000</b><br>sometimes sometimes everybody overreacts<br></p><p><b>00:08:51.000 - 00:08:52.600</b><br>and you get this massive spike down<br></p><p><b>00:08:52.600 - 00:08:54.733</b><br>and a massive pop right back up<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.866 - 00:08:57.133</b><br>so I mean you can quickly quickly<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.766 - 00:09:00.166</b><br>make tons of free bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.300 - 00:09:02.733</b><br>by just having orders set up under that 15<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.566 -

00:09:11.666</b><br>on other exchanges though we're looking at Bitrex<br></p><p><b>00:09:11.733 - 00:09:14.500</b><br>on other exchanges like Kryptopia<br></p><p><b>00:09:15.500 - 00:09:16.300</b><br>Liquid<br></p><p><b>00:09:17.066 -

00:11:12.766</b><br>they've got that extra coin<br></p><p><b>00:11:13.000 - 00:11:15.200</b><br>now they just want to get their Bitcoin to safe<br></p><p><b>00:11:15.200 - 00:11:15.966</b><br>to a safe place<br></p><p><b>00:11:15.966 - 00:11:17.166</b><br>so they go to fiat<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.166 - 00:11:19.266</b><br>and that causes a little bit of a dump<br></p><p><b>00:11:19.600 - 00:11:23.666</b><br>but then if some big guy manages to push the price up<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.500 - 00:11:27.533</b><br>over 29 that would cause pain for<br></p><p><b>00:11:27.533 - 00:11:29.700</b><br>all of these guys that got short<br></p><p><b>00:11:29.966 - 00:11:31.900</b><br>and there's not a lot here but<br></p><p><b>00:11:32.200 -

00:11:38.733</b><br>and then the whole thing just spikes<br></p><p><b>00:11:38.733 - 00:11:40.000</b><br>crazy upwards<br></p><p><b>00:11:42.166 - 00:11:44.166</b><br>that's unlikely that I would<br></p><p><b>00:11:44.300 -

00:11:50.266</b><br>just discussed that if this thing's gonna crash<br></p><p><b>00:11:50.333 - 00:11:51.300</b><br>we're all gonna have a<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.333 - 00:11:53.366</b><br>big beautiful opportunity to get long<br></p><p><b>00:11:53.500 -

00:12:02.933</b><br>but here's the thing<br></p><p><b>00:12:03.533 - 00:12:05.000</b><br>if you're trading like me<br></p><p><b>00:12:05.266 - 00:12:08.066</b><br>you're only taking positions under these bases<br></p><p><b>00:12:08.533 -

00:13:38.066</b><br>so anyway<br></p><p><b>00:13:38.066 - 00:13:39.466</b><br>I just want to make this quick video so that<br></p><p><b>00:13:39.466 - 00:13:41.533</b><br>you'd be aware of the opportunity<br></p><p><b>00:13:41.666 -

00:14:04.366</b><br>cold storage and I will get the bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:14:05.666 - 00:14:07.733</b><br>cache along with my bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:14:07.733 - 00:14:10.466</b><br>because I'll be able to make that split myself later<br></p><p><b>00:14:11.133 - 00:14:13.700</b><br>and I'm only going to participate<br></p><p><b>00:14:14.466 - 00:14:17.333</b><br>in any drop below these bases<br></p><p><b>00:14:17.466 - 00:14:19.200</b><br>that's it that's my plate<br></p><p><b>00:14:19.333 - 00:14:21.333</b><br>now what's going to happen with Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:14:21.600 - 00:14:26.266</b><br>well ethereum generally falls when Bitcoin falls<br></p><p><b>00:14:26.700 - 00:14:28.300</b><br>so here's the Ethereum chart<br></p><p><b>00:14:28.300 - 00:14:31.333</b><br>and let's just draw our bases real quick<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.733 - 00:14:34.566</b><br>so obvious obvious 135<br></p><p><b>00:14:34.733 - 00:14:36.733</b><br>that's just so obvious right<br></p><p><b>00:14:37.133 - 00:14:37.933</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:14:38.766 - 00:14:40.266</b><br>even further down from that<br></p><p><b>00:14:40.266 - 00:14:41.600</b><br>probably the 100 level<br></p><p><b>00:14:41.600 - 00:14:43.900</b><br>I would say would be pretty distinct and obvious<br></p><p><b>00:14:44.066 - 00:14:45.733</b><br>so under these levels<br></p><p><b>00:14:46.066 - 00:14:48.300</b><br>especially if you get a very quick spike down<br></p><p><b>00:14:48.666 - 00:14:51.400</b><br>boy that's an opportunity and that could happen<br></p><p><b>00:14:51.600 - 00:14:53.300</b><br>so where do you put your money<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.300 - 00:14:53.800</b><br>are you gonna<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.800 - 00:14:55.166</b><br>are you gonna stick your money in<br></p><p><b>00:14:55.166 - 00:14:56.600</b><br>bitcoin when it spikes down<br></p><p><b>00:14:56.600 - 00:14:58.266</b><br>are you gonna stick your money in Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:14:58.266 - 00:14:59.366</b><br>when it spikes down<br></p><p><b>00:15:01.066 - 00:15:03.000</b><br>I can't advise you I don't know<br></p><p><b>00:15:03.266 - 00:15:05.266</b><br>I know I would like to get some<br></p><p><b>00:15:05.266 - 00:15:06.900</b><br>solid Ethereum down there<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.166 - 00:15:08.700</b><br>but both are safe<br></p><p><b>00:15:08.700 - 00:15:11.366</b><br>bitcoin and Ethereum are both safe<br></p><p><b>00:15:11.366 - 00:15:13.700</b><br>and generally when Bitcoin goes down hard<br></p><p><b>00:15:13.733 - 00:15:15.166</b><br>ethereum goes down hard to<br></p><p><b>00:15:15.400 - 00:15:19.533</b><br>so we could get spikes I would be watching<br></p><p><b>00:15:19.533 - 00:15:22.333</b><br>I put up a bunch of charts on my screens<br></p><p><b>00:15:22.333 - 00:15:23.133</b><br>that's what I'm going to do<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.133 - 00:15:26.333</b><br>put a bunch of charts up on different exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:15:26.500 - 00:15:28.600</b><br>with just Ethereum and Bitcoin<br></p><p><b>00:15:28.600 -

00:15:37.566</b><br>on those spikes<br></p><p><b>00:15:38.400 - 00:15:42.666</b><br>on anything down underneath these bases under 135<br></p><p><b>00:15:42.766 - 00:15:44.133</b><br>and under 100<br></p><p><b>00:15:44.533 - 00:15:47.900</b><br>and then we've already discussed decoins numbers<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.900 - 00:15:49.700</b><br>so just as bonus<br></p><p><b>00:15:49.700 - 00:15:50.466</b><br>I'm going to show you a few<br></p><p><b>00:15:50.466 - 00:15:51.566</b><br>trades that I took this weekend<br></p><p><b>00:15:51.566 - 00:15:52.600</b><br>really quickly here<br></p><p><b>00:15:53.200 - 00:15:54.733</b><br>I took Friday off<br></p><p><b>00:15:54.733 - 00:15:57.733</b><br>I was doing roller coasters at amusement park with my<br></p><p><b>00:15:57.733 - 00:15:58.266</b><br>brother<br></p><p><b>00:15:58.266 - 00:16:01.066</b><br>and my nieces and nephews and his wife and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:16:01.700 - 00:16:05.166</b><br>and so I was in line actually executing traits<br></p><p><b>00:16:05.400 - 00:16:06.300</b><br>you know between<br></p><p><b>00:16:06.900 - 00:16:09.166</b><br>rides and whatnot was wonderful<br></p><p><b>00:16:09.900 - 00:16:11.533</b><br>so anyway these are small traits<br></p><p><b>00:16:12.000 - 00:16:15.100</b><br>I got in here on Aeon<br></p><p><b>00:16:16.166 - 00:16:18.400</b><br>on Vitrex you can see I got in at<br></p><p><b>00:16:19.066 - 00:16:22.000</b><br>15 and I sold at 18 to 19s<br></p><p><b>00:16:22.066 - 00:16:24.266</b><br>so big beautiful percentages<br></p><p><b>00:16:25.500 - 00:16:27.300</b><br>for a day that I was taking off here<br></p><p><b>00:16:27.300 - 00:16:28.600</b><br>what else do I got Dar<br></p><p><b>00:16:29.300 - 00:16:31.733</b><br>Dar you can see clear bases<br></p><p><b>00:16:31.933 - 00:16:33.666</b><br>the base is very clear here<br></p><p><b>00:16:33.933 - 00:16:36.166</b><br>I did a horrible job of execution on this<br></p><p><b>00:16:36.166 - 00:16:39.733</b><br>I got 70s and it went to 60's and it went<br></p><p><b>00:16:39.733 - 00:16:42.600</b><br>50's and actually think it got all the way down to 45<br></p><p><b>00:16:42.600 - 00:16:44.366</b><br>before it bounced all the way back up to 80<br></p><p><b>00:16:44.566 - 00:16:47.600</b><br>so anyway I bought 70's and sold 80's<br></p><p><b>00:16:47.866 - 00:16:49.133</b><br>I did do a really good job with that<br></p><p><b>00:16:49.133 - 00:16:50.133</b><br>but anyway there's a<br></p><p><b>00:16:50.133 - 00:16:52.300</b><br>quick trade with nice percentages<br></p><p><b>00:16:52.800 - 00:16:55.400</b><br>Gam this is an account builder type trade<br></p><p><b>00:16:55.800 -

00:17:03.466</b><br>only get half filled you know<br></p><p><b>00:17:03.566 - 00:17:05.100</b><br>so it doesn't make the little arrow for us<br></p><p><b>00:17:05.100 - 00:17:06.400</b><br>but you can see I soldered there<br></p><p><b>00:17:07.733 - 00:17:09.000</b><br>but anyway I got the<br></p><p><b>00:17:09.666 - 00:17:10.800</b><br>19s and I got the<br></p><p><b>00:17:10.800 - 00:17:14.400</b><br>18s and I sold the 250s and I sold the 21s<br></p><p><b>00:17:14.600 -
