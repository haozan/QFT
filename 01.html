00:00:06.866</b><br>I want to touch on<br></p><p><b>00:00:06.866 - 00:00:07.866</b><br>EOS 2<br></p><p><b>00:00:08.766 - 00:00:12.000</b><br>now I realized that you know this is video 2<br></p><p><b>00:00:12.300 - 00:00:14.066</b><br>and most of the videos are going to be<br></p><p><b>00:00:14.066 - 00:00:15.566</b><br>about the basics right now about<br></p><p><b>00:00:15.766 - 00:00:16.966</b><br>how you read volume<br></p><p><b>00:00:17.966 - 00:00:19.100</b><br>how do you read<br></p><p><b>00:00:19.266 - 00:00:21.000</b><br>price charts so that you know where<br></p><p><b>00:00:21.000 - 00:00:22.166</b><br>things are going to move<br></p><p><b>00:00:23.600 -

00:00:32.566</b><br>some of my followers that are saying<br></p><p><b>00:00:32.800 - 00:00:34.600</b><br>I'm a new trader and<br></p><p><b>00:00:34.700 - 00:00:36.666</b><br>I want to make safe trades<br></p><p><b>00:00:36.666 - 00:00:38.566</b><br>but I'm nervous and so forth<br></p><p><b>00:00:38.666 - 00:00:39.466</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:00:40.166 - 00:00:41.566</b><br>I just want to make a quick video about<br></p><p><b>00:00:41.566 - 00:00:42.300</b><br>Ethereum because<br></p><p><b>00:00:42.300 - 00:00:43.766</b><br>Ethereum happens to be<br></p><p><b>00:00:43.933 - 00:00:45.600</b><br>the absolute safest<br></p><p><b>00:00:45.733 - 00:00:48.900</b><br>trading vehicle I can see out there in the crypto world<br></p><p><b>00:00:49.666 - 00:00:51.800</b><br>I just I can't say anything better<br></p><p><b>00:00:51.900 - 00:00:54.866</b><br>I've been trading off Ethereum for months<br></p><p><b>00:00:55.100 - 00:00:57.400</b><br>and you just cannot make a losing trait<br></p><p><b>00:00:57.400 - 00:01:00.066</b><br>if you use my strategy with theorium<br></p><p><b>00:01:00.066 - 00:01:02.600</b><br>it's just one of those absolute safe place<br></p><p><b>00:01:02.900 - 00:01:03.500</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:03.500 - 00:01:05.400</b><br>I thought I'd go through the chart with you guys<br></p><p><b>00:01:05.400 - 00:01:06.200</b><br>a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:01:06.200 - 00:01:08.533</b><br>so that you could really see what I'm telling you<br></p><p><b>00:01:09.066 - 00:01:10.666</b><br>I understand that some of<br></p><p><b>00:01:10.933 - 00:01:13.766</b><br>the new people watching this video probably don't know<br></p><p><b>00:01:14.333 - 00:01:16.333</b><br>even just the basics of how I trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:16.333 - 00:01:19.000</b><br>but basically how I trade<br></p><p><b>00:01:19.000 - 00:01:20.500</b><br>if we're going to just take a look at it<br></p><p><b>00:01:20.533 - 00:01:21.366</b><br>quickly here<br></p><p><b>00:01:22.000 - 00:01:23.166</b><br>I'm looking for<br></p><p><b>00:01:23.200 - 00:01:25.266</b><br>support and resistance but I'm looking for<br></p><p><b>00:01:25.866 - 00:01:26.933</b><br>I call it a base<br></p><p><b>00:01:26.933 - 00:01:28.966</b><br>I'm looking for the support on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:29.133 - 00:01:31.166</b><br>I don't care what the price of the chart is<br></p><p><b>00:01:31.166 - 00:01:33.166</b><br>I don't care how high it's going<br></p><p><b>00:01:33.966 - 00:01:35.766</b><br>I don't try to predict what's going to happen<br></p><p><b>00:01:35.966 - 00:01:36.466</b><br>I just<br></p><p><b>00:01:36.466 - 00:01:39.500</b><br>I'm a reactive trader and I trade based off the chart<br></p><p><b>00:01:39.500 - 00:01:40.300</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:01:40.800 - 00:01:42.533</b><br>if you take a look at this chart right here<br></p><p><b>00:01:44.400 - 00:01:45.966</b><br>you've got support you've got<br></p><p><b>00:01:46.266 - 00:01:49.733</b><br>resistance up here right so around 400 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:01:49.933 - 00:01:51.766</b><br>you know the price was trying to get up there<br></p><p><b>00:01:51.766 - 00:01:53.366</b><br>and then it hit 400 dollars and then<br></p><p><b>00:01:53.366 - 00:01:54.500</b><br>that became resistance<br></p><p><b>00:01:54.500 - 00:01:55.600</b><br>and it just could not<br></p><p><b>00:01:55.600 - 00:01:57.866</b><br>break that and eventually fell over right<br></p><p><b>00:01:58.500 - 00:02:02.366</b><br>and if you were to look at regular<br></p><p><b>00:02:05.133 - 00:02:07.300</b><br>technical analysis that people do<br></p><p><b>00:02:07.466 - 00:02:08.533</b><br>what they would do<br></p><p><b>00:02:08.866 - 00:02:11.266</b><br>is they would draw a line from this point<br></p><p><b>00:02:11.566 - 00:02:12.566</b><br>here let me just<br></p><p><b>00:02:12.800 - 00:02:15.000</b><br>figure out how to draw a line okay<br></p><p><b>00:02:15.000 - 00:02:15.800</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:02:16.733 - 00:02:17.800</b><br>I just figured out how to draw a line<br></p><p><b>00:02:17.800 - 00:02:20.700</b><br>I don't usually I don't even draw lines on charts<br></p><p><b>00:02:21.566 - 00:02:23.533</b><br>I do my charts naked but<br></p><p><b>00:02:24.333 - 00:02:25.066</b><br>okay so<br></p><p><b>00:02:25.066 - 00:02:27.200</b><br>for the purpose of this video I'm going to draw a line<br></p><p><b>00:02:27.200 - 00:02:28.733</b><br>so normal technical analysis<br></p><p><b>00:02:28.733 - 00:02:29.966</b><br>you would take the low here<br></p><p><b>00:02:30.400 - 00:02:32.466</b><br>and then you would draw a line and you would hit<br></p><p><b>00:02:33.466 - 00:02:35.966</b><br>this low here and this low here<br></p><p><b>00:02:36.100 - 00:02:37.600</b><br>and right there<br></p><p><b>00:02:37.800 - 00:02:41.300</b><br>where it finally cracks past these three points<br></p><p><b>00:02:41.533 - 00:02:43.100</b><br>that would be a drop off<br></p><p><b>00:02:43.100 - 00:02:45.200</b><br>that would be where it looks like<br></p><p><b>00:02:45.500 - 00:02:47.900</b><br>the trend is not continuing and things going<br></p><p><b>00:02:47.900 - 00:02:49.100</b><br>to fall apart and it falls down<br></p><p><b>00:02:50.000 - 00:02:51.900</b><br>which it did and that's because<br></p><p><b>00:02:51.966 - 00:02:54.900</b><br>lots of people follow this way of trading<br></p><p><b>00:02:54.966 - 00:02:58.066</b><br>and so if it manages to break this line<br></p><p><b>00:02:59.100 - 00:03:02.000</b><br>right here they would consider shorting stock<br></p><p><b>00:03:02.133 - 00:03:04.500</b><br>or at least exiting the position that they were in<br></p><p><b>00:03:04.666 - 00:03:05.766</b><br>and which would have been great<br></p><p><b>00:03:05.766 - 00:03:07.600</b><br>you know you're exiting around three to 3<br></p><p><b>00:03:07.666 - 00:03:08.700</b><br>hundred dollars<br></p><p><b>00:03:08.733 - 00:03:10.933</b><br>and the thing fall all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:03:11.066 - 00:03:14.000</b><br>in this chart $185<br></p><p><b>00:03:14.266 - 00:03:15.400</b><br>so that would have been great<br></p><p><b>00:03:15.400 - 00:03:16.966</b><br>to get out of it at that point<br></p><p><b>00:03:18.900 - 00:03:21.000</b><br>so if you were a lucky trader<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.000 - 00:03:21.966</b><br>and you managed to<br></p><p><b>00:03:21.966 - 00:03:23.500</b><br>somehow figure out a way to get into<br></p><p><b>00:03:23.500 - 00:03:24.700</b><br>Ethereum down here<br></p><p><b>00:03:24.766 - 00:03:25.733</b><br>and you rode it up and you<br></p><p><b>00:03:25.733 - 00:03:26.966</b><br>rode it up and you rode it up<br></p><p><b>00:03:27.066 - 00:03:28.700</b><br>this would be a great place to exit<br></p><p><b>00:03:28.900 - 00:03:31.366</b><br>and if it happens to be your strategy<br></p><p><b>00:03:31.500 - 00:03:32.533</b><br>that you're shorter<br></p><p><b>00:03:32.533 - 00:03:34.400</b><br>and you're looking for a good place to short<br></p><p><b>00:03:34.466 - 00:03:36.100</b><br>well then this would have been a great place to short<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.100 - 00:03:36.933</b><br>right after it<br></p><p><b>00:03:36.933 - 00:03:39.566</b><br>cracks this and it does a little bit of a turn up<br></p><p><b>00:03:39.766 - 00:03:41.866</b><br>that would be a great short and you get to profit<br></p><p><b>00:03:41.866 - 00:03:42.466</b><br>you know like<br></p><p><b>00:03:42.466 - 00:03:47.100</b><br>100 dollars like 100 points on this coin<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.066 - 00:03:48.966</b><br>but that's not how I trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:48.966 - 00:03:50.966</b><br>so let's see if we can get rid of this line<br></p><p><b>00:03:52.166 - 00:03:56.800</b><br>and do things like that yeah okay so the line's about<br></p><p><b>00:03:57.400 - 00:03:58.533</b><br>how do I trade<br></p><p><b>00:03:58.733 - 00:04:00.466</b><br>well like I said to you before<br></p><p><b>00:04:00.866 - 00:04:02.066</b><br>in the previous video<br></p><p><b>00:04:02.400 - 00:04:04.666</b><br>I buy dips<br></p><p><b>00:04:04.800 - 00:04:08.333</b><br>on stocks or in this case a coin<br></p><p><b>00:04:08.666 - 00:04:11.300</b><br>that absolutely every time<br></p><p><b>00:04:11.566 - 00:04:13.666</b><br>there's a surprise it rebounds<br></p><p><b>00:04:13.666 - 00:04:16.000</b><br>every single base that gets cracked<br></p><p><b>00:04:16.933 - 00:04:18.900</b><br>gives you a payoff so<br></p><p><b>00:04:20.133 - 00:04:22.966</b><br>especially on a theorem I haven't found one crack<br></p><p><b>00:04:23.066 - 00:04:25.000</b><br>that you wouldn't have made money on not one<br></p><p><b>00:04:25.000 - 00:04:26.300</b><br>and we'll go through the chart together<br></p><p><b>00:04:26.300 - 00:04:27.566</b><br>really quickly and look<br></p><p><b>00:04:27.733 - 00:04:29.533</b><br>to see if we can find a crack<br></p><p><b>00:04:29.766 - 00:04:31.300</b><br>that you wouldn't have made money on<br></p><p><b>00:04:31.500 - 00:04:32.300</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:04:32.333 - 00:04:33.766</b><br>what I do is I<br></p><p><b>00:04:34.000 - 00:04:36.800</b><br>think in terms of support resistance<br></p><p><b>00:04:36.966 - 00:04:39.933</b><br>but I'm looking for a good firm base<br></p><p><b>00:04:39.933 - 00:04:42.366</b><br>so let me pick a different color here<br></p><p><b>00:04:43.266 - 00:04:45.500</b><br>right there okay that's good<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.166 - 00:04:46.966</b><br>that'll draw a line<br></p><p><b>00:04:46.966 - 00:04:48.366</b><br>yeah okay all right so<br></p><p><b>00:04:49.333 - 00:04:50.933</b><br>you take a look at this chart right here<br></p><p><b>00:04:51.200 - 00:04:52.366</b><br>and you know<br></p><p><b>00:04:52.366 - 00:04:54.200</b><br>you see the price went up went up went up went up<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.200 - 00:04:54.866</b><br>went up<br></p><p><b>00:04:54.866 - 00:04:56.666</b><br>and right around here<br></p><p><b>00:04:56.666 - 00:04:59.300</b><br>it's starting to form a little bit of a vase<br></p><p><b>00:04:59.500 - 00:05:00.700</b><br>when it tried to pull back<br></p><p><b>00:05:00.700 - 00:05:02.100</b><br>it just can't get through that<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.100 - 00:05:02.866</b><br>can't get through that<br></p><p><b>00:05:02.866 - 00:05:04.933</b><br>and then it goes up right so<br></p><p><b>00:05:04.933 - 00:05:06.533</b><br>let's say this is your vase<br></p><p><b>00:05:06.533 - 00:05:07.733</b><br>so that's your vase<br></p><p><b>00:05:08.400 - 00:05:10.733</b><br>when the thing finally decides to turn around<br></p><p><b>00:05:11.500 - 00:05:12.333</b><br>it has to<br></p><p><b>00:05:12.333 - 00:05:14.666</b><br>you know like if we blow this up<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.133 - 00:05:16.500</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:05:16.500 - 00:05:18.533</b><br>just a second let me figure out how to use this<br></p><p><b>00:05:19.400 - 00:05:20.800</b><br>now I'm making a mess okay<br></p><p><b>00:05:20.800 - 00:05:22.100</b><br>so let's get rid of that<br></p><p><b>00:05:23.400 - 00:05:25.600</b><br>I think I go pointer yeah okay<br></p><p><b>00:05:26.366 - 00:05:27.500</b><br>all right let's blow this up<br></p><p><b>00:05:27.533 - 00:05:29.566</b><br>so that you can really see what I'm talking about<br></p><p><b>00:05:29.866 - 00:05:30.400</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:05:30.400 - 00:05:32.500</b><br>you'll see that it ran up over here<br></p><p><b>00:05:32.500 - 00:05:35.166</b><br>it fell down and hit that base<br></p><p><b>00:05:35.166 - 00:05:37.900</b><br>and you got a beautiful pop off of that<br></p><p><b>00:05:38.333 - 00:05:39.966</b><br>that makes the base<br></p><p><b>00:05:39.966 - 00:05:42.000</b><br>that means that when you see a reaction<br></p><p><b>00:05:42.000 - 00:05:43.533</b><br>when you see that it came back<br></p><p><b>00:05:43.600 - 00:05:45.366</b><br>and the reaction was big<br></p><p><b>00:05:45.700 - 00:05:48.066</b><br>that means that in this argument<br></p><p><b>00:05:48.366 - 00:05:50.500</b><br>where there's buyers and sellers and they can't<br></p><p><b>00:05:50.500 - 00:05:52.200</b><br>and are trying to discover<br></p><p><b>00:05:52.366 - 00:05:54.000</b><br>the price of Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:05:54.866 - 00:05:58.100</b><br>there's a lot of buyers even though over here<br></p><p><b>00:05:58.366 -

00:08:06.533</b><br>well you can read<br></p><p><b>00:08:06.733 - 00:08:09.300</b><br>volume and you can try to find the bottom<br></p><p><b>00:08:09.366 - 00:08:10.266</b><br>you can do that<br></p><p><b>00:08:10.266 -

00:08:18.166</b><br>because it's all safe<br></p><p><b>00:08:18.733 - 00:08:20.800</b><br>this was a major surprise<br></p><p><b>00:08:21.066 - 00:08:22.566</b><br>it's coming off a very<br></p><p><b>00:08:22.566 - 00:08:23.900</b><br>very high top where<br></p><p><b>00:08:23.900 - 00:08:25.900</b><br>everybody thinks it's going over 400<br></p><p><b>00:08:25.966 - 00:08:28.266</b><br>so there's tons of people to be shocked<br></p><p><b>00:08:28.600 - 00:08:31.333</b><br>so that makes this crazy drop in this<br></p><p><b>00:08:31.333 - 00:08:34.133</b><br>big panic and beautiful beautiful trait<br></p><p><b>00:08:34.133 - 00:08:37.200</b><br>and look at the percentages huge percentages right<br></p><p><b>00:08:37.700 - 00:08:39.666</b><br>and this happens over and over again so<br></p><p><b>00:08:40.066 - 00:08:43.000</b><br>now that this happened where is your base<br></p><p><b>00:08:43.166 - 00:08:45.466</b><br>well I would consider your base somewhere between<br></p><p><b>00:08:45.900 - 00:08:48.800</b><br>where there's a good chunk of volume right here<br></p><p><b>00:08:49.166 - 00:08:50.333</b><br>and right there<br></p><p><b>00:08:50.333 - 00:08:53.133</b><br>so somewhere in here is your base so let's draw a line<br></p><p><b>00:08:54.866 - 00:08:57.000</b><br>let me figure out how to do that again right here<br></p><p><b>00:08:57.700 - 00:09:00.000</b><br>so we draw a line so there is your base<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.000 - 00:09:00.800</b><br>pretty clear<br></p><p><b>00:09:00.900 - 00:09:03.300</b><br>actually you can see that right here<br></p><p><b>00:09:03.733 - 00:09:05.800</b><br>touched and right here touched<br></p><p><b>00:09:05.800 - 00:09:08.600</b><br>so really accurately your base would probably be this<br></p><p><b>00:09:08.966 - 00:09:10.266</b><br>this is more likely your base<br></p><p><b>00:09:10.266 - 00:09:12.100</b><br>but you can even make that your base<br></p><p><b>00:09:12.133 - 00:09:14.133</b><br>anywhere in this area is your base<br></p><p><b>00:09:14.133 - 00:09:15.566</b><br>so let's zoom out a little bit<br></p><p><b>00:09:16.000 - 00:09:18.066</b><br>and let me allow it to move over the chart<br></p><p><b>00:09:19.366 - 00:09:22.500</b><br>all right so what happens when you surprise and you<br></p><p><b>00:09:22.500 - 00:09:23.866</b><br>crack that base again<br></p><p><b>00:09:24.733 - 00:09:25.766</b><br>well right here<br></p><p><b>00:09:25.766 - 00:09:28.666</b><br>where is the safe place to buy I mean this is Ethereum<br></p><p><b>00:09:28.666 - 00:09:31.100</b><br>you can't find a spot on this chart where you<br></p><p><b>00:09:31.100 - 00:09:33.500</b><br>crack a base and<br></p><p><b>00:09:33.900 - 00:09:34.933</b><br>it doesn't pay<br></p><p><b>00:09:35.333 - 00:09:38.966</b><br>every crack gets a bounce every crack gets a bounce<br></p><p><b>00:09:39.000 - 00:09:42.533</b><br>so this crack right here of this major base<br></p><p><b>00:09:42.666 - 00:09:44.200</b><br>you know where it held up last time<br></p><p><b>00:09:44.200 - 00:09:46.600</b><br>and it caused them a huge jump<br></p><p><b>00:09:46.800 - 00:09:49.300</b><br>so that tells you that this is the correct location<br></p><p><b>00:09:49.666 - 00:09:50.600</b><br>this crack<br></p><p><b>00:09:51.533 - 00:09:52.733</b><br>you get all<br></p><p><b>00:09:52.800 - 00:09:55.466</b><br>down to you know I actually bought at<br></p><p><b>00:09:55.533 - 00:09:56.333</b><br></p><p><b>00:09:57.133 - 00:09:58.600</b><br>that was insane but anyway<br></p><p><b>00:09:58.700 - 00:10:01.966</b><br>you get all the way down to 185 and this monster jump<br></p><p><b>00:10:01.966 - 00:10:03.566</b><br>almost double your money<br></p><p><b>00:10:03.566 - 00:10:05.700</b><br>320 so like 40 percent<br></p><p><b>00:10:06.000 - 00:10:07.966</b><br>jump is that insane<br></p><p><b>00:10:09.900 - 00:10:11.166</b><br>so I mean<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.166 - 00:10:11.666</b><br>these<br></p><p><b>00:10:11.666 - 00:10:15.133</b><br>trades are right there and they're completely safe<br></p><p><b>00:10:15.133 - 00:10:16.100</b><br>and even though<br></p><p><b>00:10:16.100 - 00:10:19.066</b><br>it's scary you'd be thinking oh my goodness<br></p><p><b>00:10:19.066 - 00:10:21.466</b><br>this thing could fall away to $100<br></p><p><b>00:10:22.000 - 00:10:23.733</b><br>but it doesn't matter<br></p><p><b>00:10:23.933 - 00:10:25.766</b><br>if it fell all the way to 100 dollars<br></p><p><b>00:10:25.766 - 00:10:29.466</b><br>if it did it would bounce all the way back up to 280<br></p><p><b>00:10:30.300 - 00:10:32.866</b><br>because that's theorem there's enough<br></p><p><b>00:10:33.100 - 00:10:35.766</b><br>there's there's enough thickness of an argument<br></p><p><b>00:10:35.766 - 00:10:37.700</b><br>there's enough people who believe in<br></p><p><b>00:10:37.733 - 00:10:41.166</b><br>you know this this platform and all these d apps and<br></p><p><b>00:10:41.300 - 00:10:43.366</b><br>everything that's all the Icos that are coming out<br></p><p><b>00:10:43.366 -

00:13:33.000</b><br>base you got to drop all the way down to here<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.366 - 00:13:35.100</b><br>and bounce right back up<br></p><p><b>00:13:35.100 - 00:13:36.366</b><br>so all the way down to<br></p><p><b>00:13:36.366 -

00:15:21.333</b><br>this is the crack<br></p><p><b>00:15:21.333 - 00:15:23.700</b><br>and it bounced all the way to there this was<br></p><p><b>00:15:23.700 - 00:15:24.866</b><br>obviously this is your base<br></p><p><b>00:15:24.866 -

00:24:58.200</b><br>you'll notice that my<br></p><p><b>00:24:58.500 - 00:24:59.566</b><br>charts are at one hour<br></p><p><b>00:24:59.566 - 00:25:02.100</b><br>intervals like these are one hour bar charts<br></p><p><b>00:25:02.866 -

00:25:32.866</b><br>any of this happens<br></p><p><b>00:25:34.266 - 00:25:36.200</b><br>when we're all the way over here and before<br></p><p><b>00:25:36.200 - 00:25:37.133</b><br>anything of this happens<br></p><p><b>00:25:37.133 -
