<html><body><p>hey guys</p><p></p><p>it's Sunday night</p><p></p><p>and I just wanted to make a quick video about Ethereum</p><p></p><p>I want to touch on</p><p></p><p>EOS 2</p><p></p><p>now I realized that you know this is video 2</p><p></p><p>and most of the videos are going to be</p><p></p><p>about the basics right now about</p><p></p><p>how you read volume</p><p></p><p>how do you read</p><p></p><p>price charts so that you know where</p><p></p><p>things are going to move</p><p></p><p>you know how to trade safely</p><p></p><p>and I've been getting some questions from</p><p></p><p>even just off the very first video from</p><p></p><p>some of my followers that are saying</p><p></p><p>I'm a new trader and</p><p></p><p>I want to make safe trades</p><p></p><p>but I'm nervous and so forth</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>I just want to make a quick video about</p><p></p><p>Ethereum because</p><p></p><p>Ethereum happens to be</p><p></p><p>the absolute safest</p><p></p><p>trading vehicle I can see out there in the crypto world</p><p></p><p>I just I can't say anything better</p><p></p><p>I've been trading off Ethereum for months</p><p></p><p>and you just cannot make a losing trait</p><p></p><p>if you use my strategy with theorium</p><p></p><p>it's just one of those absolute safe place</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>I thought I'd go through the chart with you guys</p><p></p><p>a little bit</p><p></p><p>so that you could really see what I'm telling you</p><p></p><p>I understand that some of</p><p></p><p>the new people watching this video probably don't know</p><p></p><p>even just the basics of how I trade</p><p></p><p>but basically how I trade</p><p></p><p>if we're going to just take a look at it</p><p></p><p>quickly here</p><p></p><p>I'm looking for</p><p></p><p>support and resistance but I'm looking for</p><p></p><p>I call it a base</p><p></p><p>I'm looking for the support on the chart</p><p></p><p>I don't care what the price of the chart is</p><p></p><p>I don't care how high it's going</p><p></p><p>I don't try to predict what's going to happen</p><p></p><p>I just</p><p></p><p>I'm a reactive trader and I trade based off the chart</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>if you take a look at this chart right here</p><p></p><p>you've got support you've got</p><p></p><p>resistance up here right so around 400 dollars</p><p></p><p>you know the price was trying to get up there</p><p></p><p>and then it hit 400 dollars and then</p><p></p><p>that became resistance</p><p></p><p>and it just could not</p><p></p><p>break that and eventually fell over right</p><p></p><p>and if you were to look at regular</p><p></p><p>technical analysis that people do</p><p></p><p>what they would do</p><p></p><p>is they would draw a line from this point</p><p></p><p>here let me just</p><p></p><p>figure out how to draw a line okay</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>I just figured out how to draw a line</p><p></p><p>I don't usually I don't even draw lines on charts</p><p></p><p>I do my charts naked but</p><p></p><p>okay so</p><p></p><p>for the purpose of this video I'm going to draw a line</p><p></p><p>so normal technical analysis</p><p></p><p>you would take the low here</p><p></p><p>and then you would draw a line and you would hit</p><p></p><p>this low here and this low here</p><p></p><p>and right there</p><p></p><p>where it finally cracks past these three points</p><p></p><p>that would be a drop off</p><p></p><p>that would be where it looks like</p><p></p><p>the trend is not continuing and things going</p><p></p><p>to fall apart and it falls down</p><p></p><p>which it did and that's because</p><p></p><p>lots of people follow this way of trading</p><p></p><p>and so if it manages to break this line</p><p></p><p>right here they would consider shorting stock</p><p></p><p>or at least exiting the position that they were in</p><p></p><p>and which would have been great</p><p></p><p>you know you're exiting around three to 3</p><p></p><p>hundred dollars</p><p></p><p>and the thing fall all the way down to</p><p></p><p>in this chart $185</p><p></p><p>so that would have been great</p><p></p><p>to get out of it at that point</p><p></p><p>so if you were a lucky trader</p><p></p><p>and you managed to</p><p></p><p>somehow figure out a way to get into</p><p></p><p>Ethereum down here</p><p></p><p>and you rode it up and you</p><p></p><p>rode it up and you rode it up</p><p></p><p>this would be a great place to exit</p><p></p><p>and if it happens to be your strategy</p><p></p><p>that you're shorter</p><p></p><p>and you're looking for a good place to short</p><p></p><p>well then this would have been a great place to short</p><p></p><p>right after it</p><p></p><p>cracks this and it does a little bit of a turn up</p><p></p><p>that would be a great short and you get to profit</p><p></p><p>you know like</p><p></p><p>100 dollars like 100 points on this coin</p><p></p><p>but that's not how I trade</p><p></p><p>so let's see if we can get rid of this line</p><p></p><p>and do things like that yeah okay so the line's about</p><p></p><p>how do I trade</p><p></p><p>well like I said to you before</p><p></p><p>in the previous video</p><p></p><p>I buy dips</p><p></p><p>on stocks or in this case a coin</p><p></p><p>that absolutely every time</p><p></p><p>there's a surprise it rebounds</p><p></p><p>every single base that gets cracked</p><p></p><p>gives you a payoff so</p><p></p><p>especially on a theorem I haven't found one crack</p><p></p><p>that you wouldn't have made money on not one</p><p></p><p>and we'll go through the chart together</p><p></p><p>really quickly and look</p><p></p><p>to see if we can find a crack</p><p></p><p>that you wouldn't have made money on</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>what I do is I</p><p></p><p>think in terms of support resistance</p><p></p><p>but I'm looking for a good firm base</p><p></p><p>so let me pick a different color here</p><p></p><p>right there okay that's good</p><p></p><p>that'll draw a line</p><p></p><p>yeah okay all right so</p><p></p><p>you take a look at this chart right here</p><p></p><p>and you know</p><p></p><p>you see the price went up went up went up went up</p><p></p><p>went up</p><p></p><p>and right around here</p><p></p><p>it's starting to form a little bit of a vase</p><p></p><p>when it tried to pull back</p><p></p><p>it just can't get through that</p><p></p><p>can't get through that</p><p></p><p>and then it goes up right so</p><p></p><p>let's say this is your vase</p><p></p><p>so that's your vase</p><p></p><p>when the thing finally decides to turn around</p><p></p><p>it has to</p><p></p><p>you know like if we blow this up</p><p></p><p>okay</p><p></p><p>just a second let me figure out how to use this</p><p></p><p>now I'm making a mess okay</p><p></p><p>so let's get rid of that</p><p></p><p>I think I go pointer yeah okay</p><p></p><p>all right let's blow this up</p><p></p><p>so that you can really see what I'm talking about</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>you'll see that it ran up over here</p><p></p><p>it fell down and hit that base</p><p></p><p>and you got a beautiful pop off of that</p><p></p><p>that makes the base</p><p></p><p>that means that when you see a reaction</p><p></p><p>when you see that it came back</p><p></p><p>and the reaction was big</p><p></p><p>that means that in this argument</p><p></p><p>where there's buyers and sellers and they can't</p><p></p><p>and are trying to discover</p><p></p><p>the price of Ethereum</p><p></p><p>there's a lot of buyers even though over here</p><p></p><p>you hit some sellers and they managed to</p><p></p><p>knock the price down</p><p></p><p>everybody was waiting and</p><p></p><p>sitting with their order right here so</p><p></p><p>you have a whole bunch of buyers that</p><p></p><p>bounced and gave us a beautiful big reaction</p><p></p><p>so you wouldn't take this trade</p><p></p><p>this is not the trade you take</p><p></p><p>but this forms the base</p><p></p><p>this tells you that there's a base there</p><p></p><p>so the base is right here again</p><p></p><p>so as the price comes down</p><p></p><p>when it cracks this base</p><p></p><p>it surprises everybody</p><p></p><p>everybody is like</p><p></p><p>you know they were all expecting a bounce right here</p><p></p><p>they're expecting it to continue</p><p></p><p>and past 400 and just keep going up</p><p></p><p>but surprise it falls down right</p><p></p><p>so that's a crack of the base and that is a surprise</p><p></p><p>and because of that surprise</p><p></p><p>you'll have a bunch of people quickly panic</p><p></p><p>and drop this price all the way down to $236</p><p></p><p>from $330 to $236</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>let me get this chart back to where it belongs here</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>this is your absolute safest place to buy now</p><p></p><p>these little bars are our bars</p><p></p><p>so when it cracked the base right here our little base</p><p></p><p>you got one hour two hour three hour four hour</p><p></p><p>five hour six hour seven hour</p><p></p><p>eight hour</p><p></p><p>nine hours before it got all the way down to 2:38</p><p></p><p>and then</p><p></p><p>huge bounce right over the next</p><p></p><p>9 to 10 hours a huge bounce</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>where's the right place to buy</p><p></p><p>okay</p><p></p><p>you've read the chart the way I would read the chart</p><p></p><p>you know that this is the base where you gonna buy</p><p></p><p>well what about if you bought right here</p><p></p><p>would that be okay</p><p></p><p>sure that's totally fine you'd have made money</p><p></p><p>what about if you bought here is that okay</p><p></p><p>sure what if you bought</p><p></p><p>7 7 hours in and you bought it two 87</p><p></p><p>also good what if you bought way down here</p><p></p><p>you got lucky and you got the two 50 good again</p><p></p><p>it doesn't matter where you buy it</p><p></p><p>you know this is one of those</p><p></p><p>questions that everybody always ask me</p><p></p><p>well how do I know where the right place to buy is</p><p></p><p>well you can read</p><p></p><p>volume and you can try to find the bottom</p><p></p><p>you can do that</p><p></p><p>but honestly I would buy here</p><p></p><p>here</p><p></p><p>here here I would I would layer in</p><p></p><p>because it's all safe</p><p></p><p>this was a major surprise</p><p></p><p>it's coming off a very</p><p></p><p>very high top where</p><p></p><p>everybody thinks it's going over 400</p><p></p><p>so there's tons of people to be shocked</p><p></p><p>so that makes this crazy drop in this</p><p></p><p>big panic and beautiful beautiful trait</p><p></p><p>and look at the percentages huge percentages right</p><p></p><p>and this happens over and over again so</p><p></p><p>now that this happened where is your base</p><p></p><p>well I would consider your base somewhere between</p><p></p><p>where there's a good chunk of volume right here</p><p></p><p>and right there</p><p></p><p>so somewhere in here is your base so let's draw a line</p><p></p><p>let me figure out how to do that again right here</p><p></p><p>so we draw a line so there is your base</p><p></p><p>pretty clear</p><p></p><p>actually you can see that right here</p><p></p><p>touched and right here touched</p><p></p><p>so really accurately your base would probably be this</p><p></p><p>this is more likely your base</p><p></p><p>but you can even make that your base</p><p></p><p>anywhere in this area is your base</p><p></p><p>so let's zoom out a little bit</p><p></p><p>and let me allow it to move over the chart</p><p></p><p>all right so what happens when you surprise and you</p><p></p><p>crack that base again</p><p></p><p>well right here</p><p></p><p>where is the safe place to buy I mean this is Ethereum</p><p></p><p>you can't find a spot on this chart where you</p><p></p><p>crack a base and</p><p></p><p>it doesn't pay</p><p></p><p>every crack gets a bounce every crack gets a bounce</p><p></p><p>so this crack right here of this major base</p><p></p><p>you know where it held up last time</p><p></p><p>and it caused them a huge jump</p><p></p><p>so that tells you that this is the correct location</p><p></p><p>this crack</p><p></p><p>you get all</p><p></p><p>down to you know I actually bought at</p><p></p><p></p><p>that was insane but anyway</p><p></p><p>you get all the way down to 185 and this monster jump</p><p></p><p>almost double your money</p><p></p><p>320 so like 40 percent</p><p></p><p>jump is that insane</p><p></p><p>so I mean</p><p></p><p>these</p><p></p><p>trades are right there and they're completely safe</p><p></p><p>and even though</p><p></p><p>it's scary you'd be thinking oh my goodness</p><p></p><p>this thing could fall away to $100</p><p></p><p>but it doesn't matter</p><p></p><p>if it fell all the way to 100 dollars</p><p></p><p>if it did it would bounce all the way back up to 280</p><p></p><p>because that's theorem there's enough</p><p></p><p>there's there's enough thickness of an argument</p><p></p><p>there's enough people who believe in</p><p></p><p>you know this this platform and all these d apps and</p><p></p><p>everything that's all the Icos that are coming out</p><p></p><p>there's enough people that believe in theorem</p><p></p><p>to counter the people who don't</p><p></p><p>and so you get a chart that always works out</p><p></p><p>every surprise gets bought</p><p></p><p>and those guys buy it all the way back up at least</p><p></p><p>to where the crack was if not further</p><p></p><p>so anyway</p><p></p><p>let's go back in time</p><p></p><p>let's just go back in time</p><p></p><p>I bought this beautiful</p><p></p><p>oh man did I ever buy that crack</p><p></p><p>this was such a good one</p><p></p><p>you know here's like</p><p></p><p>can I</p><p></p><p>get a pen again</p><p></p><p>like obvious obvious obvious</p><p></p><p>look at that base how more obvious could you be</p><p></p><p>so this whole section was just beautiful to buy right</p><p></p><p>what a gorgeous buy</p><p></p><p>all in the</p><p></p><p>1 41 21 hundreds and then huge massive bounce up to 236</p><p></p><p>let's keep going back into history</p><p></p><p>actually</p><p></p><p>I don't think I can go back into history off this way</p><p></p><p>because this is Bittrax</p><p></p><p>they won't go very much further before</p><p></p><p>we run out of history</p><p></p><p>but we can go to Kraken</p><p></p><p>Ethereum</p><p></p><p>right here</p><p></p><p>yeah so cracking</p><p></p><p>same chart right</p><p></p><p>exact same situation</p><p></p><p>our little base that was over here</p><p></p><p>let me draw in those things just so we're</p><p></p><p>you know our nice little base that was right there</p><p></p><p>and then we had that one that we spotted up here</p><p></p><p>and then as you go back in time now</p><p></p><p>you know you have an obvious one right there</p><p></p><p>obvious obvious</p><p></p><p>look at that nice balance off of there</p><p></p><p>you even had an obvious one right here</p><p></p><p>you know if you were to draw that over</p><p></p><p>boy would you ever got a nice straight off of that</p><p></p><p>okay and then</p><p></p><p>that way make it so I can move again</p><p></p><p>you go back in time</p><p></p><p>I mean you're just never going to find</p><p></p><p>a spot where the base doesn't work</p><p></p><p>you know where your leg</p><p></p><p>there you go</p><p></p><p>right there's an obvious base</p><p></p><p>you know here's an obvious base</p><p></p><p>but you never ever get to</p><p></p><p>I guess you could have maybe caught that</p><p></p><p>let me blow that up if I can</p><p></p><p>yeah</p><p></p><p>I guess you could have caught that</p><p></p><p>you could have draw</p><p></p><p>you could have drew that line right across</p><p></p><p>across to there</p><p></p><p>that thing dropped the whole way to 28 dollars</p><p></p><p>I don't even understand that</p><p></p><p>but I think I really you know</p><p></p><p>the Kraken I don't know</p><p></p><p>if they just had a thin book that day or whatever</p><p></p><p>but what a drop a</p><p></p><p>and then huge massive bounce</p><p></p><p>and then okay</p><p></p><p>so if we go back to here we can keep on scrolling back</p><p></p><p>I mean you'll just never find it</p><p></p><p>so what about way</p><p></p><p>back in the past when the thing was going down</p><p></p><p>here's a few down days right look things going down</p><p></p><p>so let's do our thing</p><p></p><p>let's make our</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>base base base there's a clear one right</p><p></p><p>base you got to drop all the way down to here</p><p></p><p>and bounce right back up</p><p></p><p>so all the way down to</p><p></p><p>48 dollars and all the way back up to 51 dollars</p><p></p><p>and then that would be your new bass</p><p></p><p>but I would even call this your bass</p><p></p><p>because that's where the chunk of the volume was</p><p></p><p>the chunk of</p><p></p><p>the playing and of the people</p><p></p><p>and you get a good crack and</p><p></p><p>bounce right back up so you're safe again</p><p></p><p>now this is clearly your bass</p><p></p><p>right that's your clear next base</p><p></p><p>so if you take any</p><p></p><p>trade under there in this whole section</p><p></p><p>what are you going to get</p><p></p><p>you're going to bounce right back up</p><p></p><p>now this is your clear base</p><p></p><p>again your clear base you can buy this whole section</p><p></p><p>and you get to bounce back up</p><p></p><p>and it just never ends</p><p></p><p>I mean we can do this all night</p><p></p><p>we can go back</p><p></p><p>let's try to go back</p><p></p><p>far enough</p><p></p><p>that</p><p></p><p>we're not going up anymore</p><p></p><p>way</p><p></p><p>way back in time</p><p></p><p>to where we're going down I got to try to find it</p><p></p><p>oh look at this</p><p></p><p>look at that there's so many down opportunities right</p><p></p><p>it's terrible so</p><p></p><p>this is where</p><p></p><p>it's just heading down</p><p></p><p>so let's draw our basis</p><p></p><p>I mean</p><p></p><p>there's got to be somewhere on this</p><p></p><p>chart where it doesn't work</p><p></p><p>so you got bass bass bass bass bass</p><p></p><p>oh wait a second Luke</p><p></p><p>what about what about here this didn't go right up</p><p></p><p>look there's a little section right here</p><p></p><p>where you could have lost money if you had Botton</p><p></p><p>if you bought right there</p><p></p><p>ha ha</p><p></p><p>perhaps</p><p></p><p>perhaps if you bought this one little spot right there</p><p></p><p>maybe maybe you could have lost money</p><p></p><p>it's possible right you could be the guy who buys</p><p></p><p>no because why would you that's not the crack</p><p></p><p>this is the crack</p><p></p><p>and it bounced all the way to there this was</p><p></p><p>obviously this is your base</p><p></p><p>right it's your base</p><p></p><p>and it bounced all the way</p><p></p><p>it got all the way down to 776 and bounced back up</p><p></p><p>and it started to form a clear base again</p><p></p><p>another crack</p><p></p><p>and then guess what</p><p></p><p>it bounced back</p><p></p><p>if you if you screwed this straight up</p><p></p><p>because you thought it wait a little bit and oh no</p><p></p><p>well it doesn't matter it came back and paid you anyway</p><p></p><p>and then here's your clear bass again</p><p></p><p>bass bass bass bass bass oh oh what's going to happen</p><p></p><p>all the way down to 710 and</p><p></p><p>all the way back up to 750</p><p></p><p>and</p><p></p><p>of course that's not going to last long before</p><p></p><p>it starts going up again because this is Ethereum</p><p></p><p>I really wish we could find</p><p></p><p>I mean I don't want to waste the whole thing going</p><p></p><p>through this trying to</p><p></p><p>prove my point but</p><p></p><p>you know you can just keep on finding these bases</p><p></p><p>drying them out where was the low</p><p></p><p>right there obviously your base bounce</p><p></p><p>and back up where is the low obvious clear base</p><p></p><p>you don't get much profit off this but bounce back up</p><p></p><p>where is the low obvious clear base</p><p></p><p>and you can buy anywhere in here</p><p></p><p>doesn't really matter</p><p></p><p>you can buy here here here here doesn't matter</p><p></p><p>and you get paid</p><p></p><p>same thing over here</p><p></p><p>as soon as it cracks you probably get in right</p><p></p><p>probably right there</p><p></p><p>because I don't you'd go right after the crack</p><p></p><p>and you get your bounce and</p><p></p><p>same thing in here</p><p></p><p>it doesn't matter where you buy you buy right there</p><p></p><p>you buy right there</p><p></p><p>you buy right here</p><p></p><p>it doesn't matter you get your bounce</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>there is nothing safer to drink</p><p></p><p>that's my point there's nothing safer to a theory</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>why try</p><p></p><p>let me try to get back</p><p></p><p>wonder if we can just</p><p></p><p>maybe if I just pick something else and come back to it</p><p></p><p>it'll set me back up probably not</p><p></p><p>I gotta actually scroll all the way back</p><p></p><p>okay</p><p></p><p>here's modern time here here's our time so</p><p></p><p>anyway again</p><p></p><p>so if you</p><p></p><p>if you've drawn all your bases and you've gone back</p><p></p><p>through the very start of</p><p></p><p>Ethereum when it first came out</p><p></p><p>you drew all your bases and you realized that every</p><p></p><p>single</p><p></p><p>trade you would have ever taken</p><p></p><p>on Ethereum would have always worked</p><p></p><p>using Luke's method</p><p></p><p>every single one every surprise</p><p></p><p>end up getting about every crack of a base</p><p></p><p>gets about every single one</p><p></p><p>then your very next crack like look right now</p><p></p><p>we're developing we got a nice little base right there</p><p></p><p>we got a nice little base right there</p><p></p><p>two bases right there</p><p></p><p>I would take this one for absolute security</p><p></p><p>but it doesn't matter</p><p></p><p>so we got two bases right now that are formed</p><p></p><p>what are the chances if it cracks this base</p><p></p><p>what are the chances you don't get about</p><p></p><p>what are the chances if you cracks that base</p><p></p><p>you don't get a bounce</p><p></p><p>I would say no chance</p><p></p><p>like I'd say your odds are 99 percent</p><p></p><p>you know after trading</p><p></p><p>theorem for as long as I have</p><p></p><p>I haven't had a losing trade ever</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>that tells you that</p><p></p><p>that's really the best way to trade</p><p></p><p>I think that's the safest way to trade</p><p></p><p>what about if you traded the other way</p><p></p><p>where you were trading</p><p></p><p>where you were buying cracks of resistance</p><p></p><p>you know where you were a breakout trader</p><p></p><p>what would happen in that case</p><p></p><p>well</p><p></p><p>you know if you're a breakout trader</p><p></p><p>where's the breakout up here</p><p></p><p>what if what if you call this your top</p><p></p><p>I got to go back to lines</p><p></p><p>let's change the color too</p><p></p><p>so let's call this a breakout trigger</p><p></p><p>what if this was your top</p><p></p><p>well is this a breakout right here</p><p></p><p>I don't know is it</p><p></p><p>would you buy there</p><p></p><p>and then all of a sudden you have to realize this crash</p><p></p><p>you know and then okay</p><p></p><p>well is this your top</p><p></p><p>is that now your top over here</p><p></p><p>obviously came up to here at stop</p><p></p><p>so is this your breakout</p><p></p><p>did you buy that yeesh</p><p></p><p>you know like where is your breakout</p><p></p><p>I mean this one would have worked</p><p></p><p>hey you bought right here that would have worked</p><p></p><p>but what are your odds</p><p></p><p>this one right here might have worked that</p><p></p><p>worked right there</p><p></p><p>right</p><p></p><p>it might have faked you out a little bit</p><p></p><p>because it starts to come down</p><p></p><p>but I mean what are your</p><p></p><p>where are your eyes</p><p></p><p>are your eyes 60 percent</p><p></p><p>50 percent</p><p></p><p>what are your chances of this being successful</p><p></p><p>whereas the way I trade it's</p><p></p><p></p><p>hundred percent chance of success on every trade</p><p></p><p>and then to take it</p><p></p><p>just one step further I don't want to make this</p><p></p><p>video too long but to take it one step further</p><p></p><p>with all the free</p><p></p><p>like you're making 10% 20% 30% on these trades</p><p></p><p>with all that and you can go any size you want</p><p></p><p>because these are very big this is a very big deal</p><p></p><p>so people are you know putting in 100 coins at a time</p><p></p><p>so you can go like $20,000 on trade</p><p></p><p>so $20,000 on a trade if you make 20%</p><p></p><p>you made $2,000 and that goes that buys you</p><p></p><p>nine or six</p><p></p><p>six coins</p><p></p><p>six coins now that you can take that were free</p><p></p><p>because you know there wasn't a gamble your trade is</p><p></p><p>going to work</p><p></p><p>so six points that you can take and you can</p><p></p><p>store them away you can throw them to a wallet</p><p></p><p>and you can keep them</p><p></p><p>and then you're into Ethereum for</p><p></p><p>when it gets to 500 or when it gets to 1,000</p><p></p><p>without any risk no risk because</p><p></p><p>all of your money is still safe</p><p></p><p>anyway that's the way I trade</p><p></p><p>I don't want to continue too long</p><p></p><p>I also want to talk just really quickly</p><p></p><p>about</p><p></p><p>EOS because EOS is going absolutely nuts right</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>here's EOS right now</p><p></p><p>this is EOS to Ethereum</p><p></p><p>and you can see that all of a sudden</p><p></p><p>you're not gonna believe that</p><p></p><p>treat I just got though on</p><p></p><p>EOS it's just beautiful</p><p></p><p>I bought 21</p><p></p><p>right here</p><p></p><p>and I</p><p></p><p>you know that is complete luck of the draw</p><p></p><p>I don't even like this color here</p><p></p><p>let's make it yellow</p><p></p><p>I bought right here 21</p><p></p><p>and I sold right here</p><p></p><p>at 55 I sold right there</p><p></p><p>I made such a beautiful tree</p><p></p><p>21 55 you know is like</p><p></p><p>two and a half times my money</p><p></p><p>it was just such a gorgeous trait</p><p></p><p>and then and then you're thinking well</p><p></p><p>but wait Luke</p><p></p><p>it gone all the way up to 90</p><p></p><p>you know</p><p></p><p>aren't you upset that</p><p></p><p>you could have made like</p><p></p><p>four or five times your money</p><p></p><p>but instead</p><p></p><p>you only took two and a half times your money</p><p></p><p>I'm happy with two and a half times money</p><p></p><p>you know</p><p></p><p>how far is this going to go well let's take a look at</p><p></p><p>over here on market capitalizations</p><p></p><p>look at this today $330 million has gotten traded on</p><p></p><p>EOS that is a big deal</p><p></p><p>right but they're doing</p><p></p><p>ICO right now that's going to go on for a year</p><p></p><p>so what are the</p><p></p><p>chances that this is not just going to pop</p><p></p><p>and come right back down</p><p></p><p>I think it's coming back down</p><p></p><p>I think in the future</p><p></p><p>I mean I really believe in us</p><p></p><p>I think in the future it's going to be a big deal</p><p></p><p>but right now</p><p></p><p>when just</p><p></p><p>just came out and a bunch of exchanges just got</p><p></p><p>just got it</p><p></p><p>and we could take a look at the exchanges right here</p><p></p><p>you know so</p><p></p><p>you can see that all the</p><p></p><p>volume was in this Chinese this</p><p></p><p>Beijing</p><p></p><p>exchange</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>you know all the volume is in that exchange and then</p><p></p><p>Kraken just today</p><p></p><p>you know</p><p></p><p>picked up EOS</p><p></p><p>so obviously</p><p></p><p>you got a bunch of volume there but that's 11 million</p><p></p><p>which is still high</p><p></p><p>but all the volume is in China and</p><p></p><p>I mean that is quite the jump</p><p></p><p>I'll tell you</p><p></p><p>it's 178% up</p><p></p><p>so</p><p></p><p>that just tells you that there's a lot</p><p></p><p>there's going to be a lot of buyers</p><p></p><p>there's a lot of buyers in that market</p><p></p><p>and it's probably going to end up being</p><p></p><p>just like Ethereum and just as safe</p><p></p><p>every dip is going to get bought</p><p></p><p>so that's all I have for you tonight</p><p></p><p>I just wanted to go over that with you because</p><p></p><p>I wanted to give</p><p></p><p>new traders a little bit of confidence</p><p></p><p>you know if you had to pick through</p><p></p><p>all these coins and believe me there's</p><p></p><p>so many safe ones it's unbelievable</p><p></p><p>I just took Ethereum because I was thinking to myself</p><p></p><p>there's going to be some new traders that want</p><p></p><p>a very safe play</p><p></p><p>they want to know</p><p></p><p>especially for their very</p><p></p><p>first few traits</p><p></p><p>they want to know that if they</p><p></p><p>if they read this chart correctly</p><p></p><p>they can have complete confidence that</p><p></p><p>all of their trades are gonna work out</p><p></p><p>and every</p><p></p><p>single trait</p><p></p><p>that I can find on the</p><p></p><p>Ethereum chart would have worked for me</p><p></p><p>every single one</p><p></p><p>and every single one that I've</p><p></p><p>ever made on Ethereum has worked for me so</p><p></p><p>you could feel free you can feel</p><p></p><p>confident to trade</p><p></p><p>Ethereum without any issue and</p><p></p><p>get your feet wet and get used to trading</p><p></p><p>then once you start to go through</p><p></p><p>all the other charts you're going to start to see it</p><p></p><p>clear as day</p><p></p><p>if you're watching my</p><p></p><p>videos from week to week</p><p></p><p>as I put out this video series</p><p></p><p>it's always going to be the same thing I'm going to</p><p></p><p>be going over</p><p></p><p>different coins and explaining you know</p><p></p><p>where I took my trades or</p><p></p><p>where would be the appropriate place to take trades</p><p></p><p>and it's gonna be the same thing</p><p></p><p>over and over and over again and just</p><p></p><p>following me through my videos</p><p></p><p>you'll probably get a lot of confidence</p><p></p><p>but I'd feel</p><p></p><p>a lot safer if</p><p></p><p>newbies people who are just fresh starting out</p><p></p><p>would take</p><p></p><p>trades on something like this and you'll notice that</p><p></p><p>you'll notice that my</p><p></p><p>charts are at one hour</p><p></p><p>intervals like these are one hour bar charts</p><p></p><p>so every bar here is an hour</p><p></p><p>that means that it's a very slow trade</p><p></p><p>you know when it cracks</p><p></p><p>you've got like four five six seven 10 hours sometimes</p><p></p><p>to get into a trade</p><p></p><p>so if you're off at work and you know you</p><p></p><p>actually what you can do is what I do</p><p></p><p>is I I'll draw my base and I'll be like okay</p><p></p><p>here's the base</p><p></p><p>I'd love it if I could buy in here</p><p></p><p>or here or here so</p><p></p><p>before</p><p></p><p>any of this happens</p><p></p><p>when we're all the way over here and before</p><p></p><p>anything of this happens</p><p></p><p>I've already know where my base is</p><p></p><p>so I'm already</p><p></p><p>putting an order right here at</p><p></p><p>280 and an order at 260 an order at 220</p><p></p><p>just an anticipation of that crack if it happens</p><p></p><p>and then when it does happen</p><p></p><p>bling bling bling bling bling you can be at work</p><p></p><p>you can be doing whatever</p><p></p><p>and you've managed to buy in</p><p></p><p>and you know I have alert set up on my phone</p><p></p><p>so when I see that I bought a bunch of stuff</p><p></p><p>then I can</p><p></p><p>go right ahead and stick a cell order right over here</p><p></p><p>sorry</p><p></p><p>I can stick accelerator right over there</p><p></p><p>anywhere anywhere in this area</p><p></p><p>and not even worry about it</p><p></p><p>I just know what's gonna happen</p><p></p><p>I know it's safe and I can just make my money that way</p><p></p><p>okay</p><p></p><p>so we're going to call it</p><p></p><p>the end of the video here</p><p></p><p>and</p><p></p><p>I hope that this</p><p></p><p>has given some of you some</p><p></p><p>confidence</p><p></p><p>and I hope you can see</p><p></p><p>basically what I'm doing I'm going to go into</p><p></p><p>much more depth in the future videos about volume</p><p></p><p>and about how to really tell</p><p></p><p>that it's a base so that you know</p><p></p><p>100 percent you're looking at the chart rate</p><p></p><p>you can always send me a question</p><p></p><p>and say Luke is there a base formed on a one hour</p><p></p><p>bar chart</p><p></p><p>on this coin at this level and I'll tell you yes or no</p><p></p><p>I'll just take a look at your chart and let you know</p><p></p><p>what I think</p><p></p><p>so with that</p><p></p><p>I'll see you in the next video and thanks for watching</p><p></p></body></html>
