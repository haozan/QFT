00:10:45.533</b><br>Pete got a hold of me a few days ago<br></p><p><b>00:10:45.700 - 00:10:46.566</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:10:47.300 - 00:10:49.000</b><br>here I'll just show you what he said<br></p><p><b>00:10:50.566 - 00:10:51.966</b><br>so Pete says hey<br></p><p><b>00:10:51.966 - 00:10:54.100</b><br>I spent many months working on a trading block<br></p><p><b>00:10:54.966 - 00:10:57.200</b><br>a scanner and I'm starting to see some good results<br></p><p><b>00:10:57.200 - 00:10:58.900</b><br>and he wanted some feedback from me<br></p><p><b>00:10:59.166 - 00:11:02.733</b><br>he wanted me to take a look at what he had made and<br></p><p><b>00:11:03.166 - 00:11:04.266</b><br>help him critique it<br></p><p><b>00:11:06.600 - 00:11:09.966</b><br>so Pete has a background working in the FX market so<br></p><p><b>00:11:10.533 - 00:11:12.566</b><br>creating algorithms and whatnot to try to trade the<br></p><p><b>00:11:12.566 - 00:11:14.966</b><br>FX market and so what he did here<br></p><p><b>00:11:14.966 - 00:11:16.100</b><br>he said that he<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.000 - 00:11:17.766</b><br>took<br></p><p><b>00:11:17.766 - 00:11:20.500</b><br>what he was working on and he stripped out all non<br></p><p><b>00:11:20.500 - 00:11:21.900</b><br>base braking strategies<br></p><p><b>00:11:21.900 - 00:11:24.200</b><br>so he's only using my strategies<br></p><p><b>00:11:24.466 - 00:11:27.666</b><br>and he's working off of the Bittrax market<br></p><p><b>00:11:28.666 - 00:11:30.933</b><br>and what were his results<br></p><p><b>00:11:31.166 - 00:11:33.733</b><br>out of 266<br></p><p><b>00:11:33.900 - 00:11:38.700</b><br>trades 265 of them resulted in a profit<br></p><p><b>00:11:39.266 - 00:11:41.666</b><br>of 266 trades<br></p><p><b>00:11:41.666 - 00:11:44.400</b><br>265 of them resulted as profit<br></p><p><b>00:11:44.900 - 00:11:47.800</b><br>so isn't that the stats that everybody wants right<br></p><p><b>00:11:48.933 - 00:11:51.066</b><br>you know that's like a win ratio of<br></p><p><b>00:11:51.066 - 00:11:53.466</b><br>99 point nine nine %<br></p><p><b>00:11:54.400 - 00:11:55.700</b><br>you know that's fantastic<br></p><p><b>00:11:56.533 - 00:11:57.300</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:11:57.300 - 00:11:59.266</b><br>it should be that way you know<br></p><p><b>00:11:59.266 - 00:12:02.533</b><br>especially with charts as easy as this is to trade<br></p><p><b>00:12:02.733 - 00:12:03.300</b><br>it should be very<br></p><p><b>00:12:03.300 - 00:12:06.666</b><br>very simple for you to do nothing but win you know<br></p><p><b>00:12:07.966 - 00:12:09.700</b><br>I think I lost a trade<br></p><p><b>00:12:11.133 - 00:12:12.766</b><br>four months ago maybe<br></p><p><b>00:12:13.533 - 00:12:15.466</b><br>you know when it starts to get difficult to remember<br></p><p><b>00:12:15.466 - 00:12:17.200</b><br>when you last lost the trade<br></p><p><b>00:12:17.366 - 00:12:18.866</b><br>that's when you're doing it right<br></p><p><b>00:12:20.333 - 00:12:21.066</b><br>so one<br></p><p><b>00:12:21.066 - 00:12:23.400</b><br>of the reasons that I'm really excited about this new<br></p><p><b>00:12:23.866 - 00:12:26.333</b><br>tool that Pete has made for us<br></p><p><b>00:12:26.566 - 00:12:27.766</b><br>spending many months<br></p><p><b>00:12:27.766 - 00:12:30.000</b><br>working on these algorithms and whatnot<br></p><p><b>00:12:30.300 - 00:12:31.933</b><br>to create this thing for us<br></p><p><b>00:12:32.800 - 00:12:35.200</b><br>one reason that I'm excited about this is because<br></p><p><b>00:12:35.200 - 00:12:36.200</b><br>it will give<br></p><p><b>00:12:36.333 - 00:12:38.200</b><br>new people confidence<br></p><p><b>00:12:38.400 - 00:12:42.666</b><br>and that's what we always run into with the new people<br></p><p><b>00:12:42.666 - 00:12:43.566</b><br>they're very<br></p><p><b>00:12:43.800 - 00:12:45.866</b><br>not confident about taking their next trip<br></p><p><b>00:12:46.566 - 00:12:48.066</b><br>they're worried about the trade and<br></p><p><b>00:12:48.533 - 00:12:50.700</b><br>they're questioning whether or not they put<br></p><p><b>00:12:51.100 - 00:12:53.300</b><br>their bases in the right places<br></p><p><b>00:12:53.700 - 00:12:54.966</b><br>that kind of rhymed but<br></p><p><b>00:12:56.800 - 00:12:58.366</b><br>one of the major problems is<br></p><p><b>00:12:58.366 - 00:13:00.533</b><br>usually that they scroll in too close<br></p><p><b>00:13:00.533 - 00:13:02.400</b><br>so they're looking at a chart like this<br></p><p><b>00:13:02.866 - 00:13:03.300</b><br>which<br></p><p><b>00:13:03.300 - 00:13:05.100</b><br>which still works I mean<br></p><p><b>00:13:05.100 - 00:13:06.700</b><br>but it's much faster<br></p><p><b>00:13:06.700 - 00:13:08.533</b><br>and they're anxious to get into a trade<br></p><p><b>00:13:08.666 - 00:13:11.100</b><br>and you know they'll be drawing their bases<br></p><p><b>00:13:12.666 - 00:13:13.900</b><br>you know like right there<br></p><p><b>00:13:14.100 - 00:13:15.700</b><br>and maybe take a trade right there<br></p><p><b>00:13:15.700 - 00:13:16.900</b><br>which works out for them<br></p><p><b>00:13:17.500 - 00:13:19.500</b><br>but now where do they where do they<br></p><p><b>00:13:19.733 - 00:13:21.700</b><br>where do they take their profit like up here<br></p><p><b>00:13:22.200 - 00:13:22.700</b><br>well look<br></p><p><b>00:13:22.700 - 00:13:24.933</b><br>how far they are from where the base originally was<br></p><p><b>00:13:25.066 - 00:13:27.700</b><br>you know like it starts to get kind of skewed<br></p><p><b>00:13:29.266 - 00:13:31.333</b><br>because they're in a chart that's too close<br></p><p><b>00:13:31.333 - 00:13:31.700</b><br>and you know<br></p><p><b>00:13:31.700 - 00:13:33.566</b><br>they're only looking at a four or five day<br></p><p><b>00:13:33.566 - 00:13:35.600</b><br>period when they should be looking at a month or two<br></p><p><b>00:13:37.000 - 00:13:38.366</b><br>all those kind of things<br></p><p><b>00:13:38.533 - 00:13:41.800</b><br>and so because you're working off a one hour bar chart<br></p><p><b>00:13:42.566 - 00:13:45.500</b><br>you got to look at a bigger picture to draw your bases<br></p><p><b>00:13:45.500 - 00:13:46.766</b><br>that was actually pretty good<br></p><p><b>00:13:46.766 - 00:13:47.400</b><br>and you know<br></p><p><b>00:13:47.400 - 00:13:49.700</b><br>if you had you drawn a base there that would work too<br></p><p><b>00:13:49.800 - 00:13:51.866</b><br>but that's not where the bases go<br></p><p><b>00:13:52.466 - 00:13:55.566</b><br>the real safe bases actually go right here<br></p><p><b>00:13:55.733 - 00:13:58.533</b><br>because how do you qualify a base off of the bounce<br></p><p><b>00:13:59.300 - 00:14:01.600</b><br>you qualify base off of the bounce<br></p><p><b>00:14:01.733 - 00:14:03.900</b><br>so you got to be looking at a bigger picture<br></p><p><b>00:14:03.900 - 00:14:06.566</b><br>to be able to say you know wow<br></p><p><b>00:14:06.566 - 00:14:08.666</b><br>that's a pretty good bounce from there to there<br></p><p><b>00:14:08.666 - 00:14:10.200</b><br>that's a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:14:10.200 - 00:14:10.533</b><br>you know<br></p><p><b>00:14:10.533 - 00:14:12.266</b><br>that's a pretty good bounce from there to there<br></p><p><b>00:14:12.266 - 00:14:13.766</b><br>this is a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:14:13.966 - 00:14:16.066</b><br>and that was a pretty good bounce over there<br></p><p><b>00:14:16.066 - 00:14:17.366</b><br>this is a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:14:17.700 - 00:14:21.300</b><br>and that's not too bad there's a base you know and<br></p><p><b>00:14:21.333 - 00:14:23.466</b><br>you have to be looking at the big picture to find<br></p><p><b>00:14:23.466 - 00:14:26.700</b><br>your bases now what if we had a charting package<br></p><p><b>00:14:27.366 - 00:14:30.800</b><br>that had an algorithm that found the bases for us<br></p><p><b>00:14:31.000 - 00:14:32.733</b><br>now you know for me<br></p><p><b>00:14:32.733 - 00:14:33.933</b><br>when I look at a chart like this<br></p><p><b>00:14:33.933 - 00:14:35.533</b><br>I don't even draw anything on it<br></p><p><b>00:14:35.533 -

00:14:49.500</b><br>that base work<br></p><p><b>00:14:49.733 - 00:14:51.200</b><br>there's a clear base<br></p><p><b>00:14:51.866 - 00:14:52.933</b><br>but what if<br></p><p><b>00:14:53.466 - 00:14:57.100</b><br>you had charts that just drew the bases for you<br></p><p><b>00:14:57.300 - 00:14:59.466</b><br>and that's what he's been working on<br></p><p><b>00:14:59.466 - 00:15:01.066</b><br>and it's not perfect<br></p><p><b>00:15:02.066 - 00:15:03.533</b><br>but here's the other thing<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.333 - 00:15:04.966</b><br>okay<br></p><p><b>00:15:04.966 - 00:15:07.966</b><br>it's a computer and it's going to make some mistakes<br></p><p><b>00:15:07.966 - 00:15:10.466</b><br>it's not always going to draw the basis perfectly<br></p><p><b>00:15:10.900 -

00:15:29.300</b><br>that's drawing pretty good basis<br></p><p><b>00:15:29.900 - 00:15:33.066</b><br>and the computer has no emotions<br></p><p><b>00:15:33.066 - 00:15:35.366</b><br>it's not in a hurry to get into a trade<br></p><p><b>00:15:35.766 - 00:15:37.000</b><br>so it's going to draw<br></p><p><b>00:15:37.333 - 00:15:37.900</b><br>based on<br></p><p><b>00:15:37.900 - 00:15:40.500</b><br>it's going to draw its bases based on the chart<br></p><p><b>00:15:40.666 - 00:15:42.500</b><br>going to look at the chart information<br></p><p><b>00:15:42.566 - 00:15:44.333</b><br>and it's very complicated<br></p><p><b>00:15:44.700 - 00:15:45.333</b><br>I'm going to go<br></p><p><b>00:15:45.333 - 00:15:47.133</b><br>over that with you guys a little bit about<br></p><p><b>00:15:47.133 - 00:15:48.966</b><br>his algorithm and the work<br></p><p><b>00:15:48.966 - 00:15:51.966</b><br>and whatnot that he put into it it's very complicated<br></p><p><b>00:15:53.066 - 00:15:55.733</b><br>but the computer can make those calculations<br></p><p><b>00:15:55.766 - 00:15:59.266</b><br>and then draw bases where it feels it's appropriate<br></p><p><b>00:15:59.366 - 00:16:01.200</b><br>whereas us as humans<br></p><p><b>00:16:01.366 -

00:17:26.066</b><br>so here's a chart that you're looking at<br></p><p><b>00:17:26.300 - 00:17:29.100</b><br>and where you're gonna draw your basis<br></p><p><b>00:17:29.400 - 00:17:32.400</b><br>well let's see where the computer draw drew its basis<br></p><p><b>00:17:32.933 - 00:17:34.733</b><br>okay so here's Pete's chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:35.166 - 00:17:37.066</b><br>of the exact same thing of Ant<br></p><p><b>00:17:37.733 - 00:17:40.300</b><br>and you're actually going to see his trades on here<br></p><p><b>00:17:40.300 - 00:17:42.900</b><br>because his trades populate onto his chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:43.400 - 00:17:46.266</b><br>but you'll be able to use this exact exact chart<br></p><p><b>00:17:46.533 - 00:17:49.333</b><br>and see all your bases drawn for you<br></p><p><b>00:17:49.533 - 00:17:52.300</b><br>now you know like look at this base right here that<br></p><p><b>00:17:52.900 - 00:17:54.266</b><br>you know because it spiked down<br></p><p><b>00:17:54.266 - 00:17:56.066</b><br>it took the very bottom of this spike<br></p><p><b>00:17:56.733 - 00:17:57.900</b><br>you know I would say<br></p><p><b>00:17:58.200 - 00:17:59.000</b><br>I would<br></p><p><b>00:17:59.133 - 00:18:01.133</b><br>use this bass before I would use this bass<br></p><p><b>00:18:01.133 - 00:18:02.900</b><br>but I mean that's nitpicking<br></p><p><b>00:18:02.933 - 00:18:04.900</b><br>for a computer to have figured this out<br></p><p><b>00:18:05.133 - 00:18:07.966</b><br>and it's drawing its bases based off of<br></p><p><b>00:18:08.133 - 00:18:09.866</b><br>you know the bounce just like we would<br></p><p><b>00:18:09.900 - 00:18:11.400</b><br>qualifies it off that bounce<br></p><p><b>00:18:11.400 - 00:18:12.866</b><br>qualifies it off that bounce<br></p><p><b>00:18:12.900 - 00:18:14.800</b><br>what's the average bounce<br></p><p><b>00:18:15.066 - 00:18:18.100</b><br>and then okay that qualifies base<br></p><p><b>00:18:18.200 - 00:18:19.600</b><br>and you can see Pete's trades<br></p><p><b>00:18:19.600 - 00:18:22.000</b><br>I mean you know here he bought at<br></p><p><b>00:18:22.400 - 00:18:24.733</b><br>you know this over a little bit cameras in my way<br></p><p><b>00:18:26.866 - 00:18:28.400</b><br>so over here he bought at<br></p><p><b>00:18:29.200 - 00:18:33.966</b><br>19 and 18 and he sold up at 21<br></p><p><b>00:18:34.600 - 00:18:35.500</b><br>and then over here you know<br></p><p><b>00:18:35.500 - 00:18:37.266</b><br>he could have bought all the way down to 10<br></p><p><b>00:18:37.600 - 00:18:38.400</b><br>10 over here<br></p><p><b>00:18:39.133 - 00:18:40.733</b><br>but he didn't he bought<br></p><p><b>00:18:41.133 - 00:18:43.000</b><br>at 15 at 14 at 13<br></p><p><b>00:18:43.466 - 00:18:45.166</b><br>and he sold everything up at 17<br></p><p><b>00:18:45.733 - 00:18:47.900</b><br>I mean is that a bad trade<br></p><p><b>00:18:48.000 - 00:18:48.800</b><br>no<br></p><p><b>00:18:49.200 - 00:18:50.700</b><br>was there any chance of losing<br></p><p><b>00:18:51.766 -

00:20:30.066</b><br>I know I'm talking softly because it's middle of the<br></p><p><b>00:20:30.066 - 00:20:31.500</b><br>night and I don't want to wake up my wife<br></p><p><b>00:20:31.700 - 00:20:32.500</b><br>but<br></p><p><b>00:20:33.366 - 00:20:34.766</b><br>I'm excited for<br></p><p><b>00:20:34.800 - 00:20:37.466</b><br>new people that this is going to give them confidence<br></p><p><b>00:20:37.666 - 00:20:38.766</b><br>that they will know<br></p><p><b>00:20:38.766 - 00:20:41.400</b><br>not to start taking trees where there's no vase<br></p><p><b>00:20:41.500 - 00:20:43.000</b><br>or above a vase<br></p><p><b>00:20:43.166 - 00:20:45.266</b><br>or drawing bases where bases don't belong<br></p><p><b>00:20:45.266 - 00:20:46.933</b><br>because they scroll into closely<br></p><p><b>00:20:47.300 - 00:20:47.933</b><br>and stuff like this<br></p><p><b>00:20:47.933 - 00:20:49.166</b><br>this really gives them a<br></p><p><b>00:20:49.166 - 00:20:51.066</b><br>chance to have a little bit more confidence<br></p><p><b>00:20:51.066 - 00:20:52.300</b><br>knowing that the computer<br></p><p><b>00:20:52.333 - 00:20:55.000</b><br>in the past has picked these bases and they worked<br></p><p><b>00:20:55.166 - 00:20:57.766</b><br>and so obviously the base that it recently picked<br></p><p><b>00:20:57.766 - 00:20:58.866</b><br>is a good base<br></p><p><b>00:21:01.333 - 00:21:03.100</b><br>so that's really great so<br></p><p><b>00:21:03.666 - 00:21:05.100</b><br>what's going to happen next what's<br></p><p><b>00:21:05.133 - 00:21:06.100</b><br>going to do for us next<br></p><p><b>00:21:06.100 - 00:21:08.933</b><br>what are the improvements that's going to be made on<br></p><p><b>00:21:09.500 - 00:21:10.300</b><br>what is<br></p><p><b>00:21:10.300 - 00:21:12.866</b><br>already an awesome tool for our community<br></p><p><b>00:21:13.533 - 00:21:15.200</b><br>so here Pete says that<br></p><p><b>00:21:15.200 - 00:21:17.533</b><br>he was originally working on a market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:21:18.066 - 00:21:19.800</b><br>you know that's what that's what he was doing<br></p><p><b>00:21:20.700 - 00:21:21.966</b><br>well I don't have a pen<br></p><p><b>00:21:22.900 - 00:21:24.566</b><br>yeah he was working on a market scanner<br></p><p><b>00:21:25.900 - 00:21:28.400</b><br>and but in order to<br></p><p><b>00:21:29.533 - 00:21:32.166</b><br>do that job he wanted to make a visualizer<br></p><p><b>00:21:32.166 - 00:21:33.300</b><br>which is what you're seeing<br></p><p><b>00:21:33.300 - 00:21:34.766</b><br>so he made a visualizer<br></p><p><b>00:21:35.000 - 00:21:38.366</b><br>and so he says what am I going to focus on next<br></p><p><b>00:21:38.466 - 00:21:40.933</b><br>he's going to focus on building the scanner<br></p><p><b>00:21:42.000 - 00:21:42.800</b><br>so<br></p><p><b>00:21:43.266 - 00:21:45.800</b><br>as good as this is as awesome as this is to be<br></p><p><b>00:21:45.800 - 00:21:47.533</b><br>able to just pull up these charts<br></p><p><b>00:21:47.533 - 00:21:49.800</b><br>and see already bases drawn for us<br></p><p><b>00:21:50.933 - 00:21:51.966</b><br>would it be awesome<br></p><p><b>00:21:52.166 - 00:21:54.700</b><br>like obviously the very next step is to<br></p><p><b>00:21:54.900 - 00:21:58.300</b><br>you know catch those base brakes and<br></p><p><b>00:21:58.666 - 00:21:59.966</b><br>have some kind of alert<br></p><p><b>00:22:00.566 - 00:22:02.666</b><br>so I don't want to put any pressure on Pete because<br></p><p><b>00:22:02.666 - 00:22:04.366</b><br>he's already done a lot of work<br></p><p><b>00:22:04.466 - 00:22:06.400</b><br>and there's a lot that goes into this<br></p><p><b>00:22:06.533 - 00:22:08.266</b><br>so when I asked Pete about what<br></p><p><b>00:22:08.966 - 00:22:11.066</b><br>could be coming he said<br></p><p><b>00:22:13.700 - 00:22:14.300</b><br>that<br></p><p><b>00:22:14.300 - 00:22:17.566</b><br>he originally ripped this tool to visualize back tests<br></p><p><b>00:22:17.700 - 00:22:20.466</b><br>but that when I told him that<br></p><p><b>00:22:20.466 - 00:22:21.300</b><br>he said you felt that<br></p><p><b>00:22:21.300 - 00:22:23.533</b><br>the community would really benefit from it<br></p><p><b>00:22:24.266 - 00:22:26.200</b><br>that he decided to make this available to us<br></p><p><b>00:22:26.200 - 00:22:27.000</b><br>which is great<br></p><p><b>00:22:27.000 - 00:22:29.466</b><br>that he was willing to do that for us<br></p><p><b>00:22:29.466 - 00:22:32.666</b><br>early before he's really got his full working product<br></p><p><b>00:22:33.866 - 00:22:35.100</b><br>but then he's going to be<br></p><p><b>00:22:35.133 - 00:22:37.466</b><br>making a market scanner his way is going to work on<br></p><p><b>00:22:37.733 - 00:22:40.933</b><br>and then he's going to be adding some more exchanges<br></p><p><b>00:22:41.500 - 00:22:42.300</b><br>and<br></p><p><b>00:22:43.700 - 00:22:45.766</b><br>different candle periods right now<br></p><p><b>00:22:46.300 - 00:22:49.800</b><br>this is only working off of one hour candles and so<br></p><p><b>00:22:50.100 - 00:22:52.066</b><br>there's lots of people who want to try to detreat<br></p><p><b>00:22:52.066 - 00:22:52.900</b><br>and stuff and<br></p><p><b>00:22:52.900 - 00:22:54.133</b><br>they would probably like<br></p><p><b>00:22:54.766 - 00:22:57.300</b><br>different candle periods and in live charts<br></p><p><b>00:22:57.366 - 00:22:58.400</b><br>so right now<br></p><p><b>00:22:59.466 - 00:23:00.666</b><br>these charts aren't live<br></p><p><b>00:23:02.200 - 00:23:03.200</b><br>which is fine<br></p><p><b>00:23:03.533 - 00:23:04.900</b><br>we don't need them to be live<br></p><p><b>00:23:04.900 - 00:23:06.966</b><br>as long as they've drawn the last base<br></p><p><b>00:23:06.966 - 00:23:08.866</b><br>that you're going to be looking at<br></p><p><b>00:23:09.166 - 00:23:10.166</b><br>that's all you really need<br></p><p><b>00:23:10.166 - 00:23:11.866</b><br>I mean it takes an hour for<br></p><p><b>00:23:11.866 - 00:23:13.700</b><br>each of these bars to populate<br></p><p><b>00:23:13.900 - 00:23:17.400</b><br>so really don't need second by second charts<br></p><p><b>00:23:17.400 - 00:23:18.566</b><br>but if that's coming<br></p><p><b>00:23:20.400 - 00:23:22.900</b><br>so then after the live charts<br></p><p><b>00:23:23.566 - 00:23:25.866</b><br>a base strength indicator<br></p><p><b>00:23:26.000 - 00:23:30.733</b><br>so like if he talks over here a score of 1 to 10<br></p><p><b>00:23:30.766 - 00:23:31.800</b><br>on looking at the<br></p><p><b>00:23:31.933 - 00:23:32.700</b><br>bases that were<br></p><p><b>00:23:32.700 - 00:23:35.100</b><br>made in the past on the chart that you're looking at<br></p><p><b>00:23:35.200 - 00:23:37.866</b><br>to see how strong this last base<br></p><p><b>00:23:37.866 - 00:23:39.366</b><br>is so that's a really nice feature<br></p><p><b>00:23:39.933 - 00:23:42.300</b><br>and then a likely entry point feature<br></p><p><b>00:23:44.166 - 00:23:47.066</b><br>and then a chart statistics feature<br></p><p><b>00:23:47.166 - 00:23:48.266</b><br>to calculate<br></p><p><b>00:23:49.900 - 00:23:54.533</b><br>the number of statistics to determine bases which are<br></p><p><b>00:23:54.766 - 00:23:56.200</b><br>useless outside the algorithm<br></p><p><b>00:23:56.200 - 00:23:58.066</b><br>I would like to add further ones<br></p><p><b>00:23:58.133 - 00:24:01.100</b><br>that I know people would like to know average panic<br></p><p><b>00:24:01.266 - 00:24:02.666</b><br>average bounce<br></p><p><b>00:24:02.933 - 00:24:04.733</b><br>number of bass cracks<br></p><p><b>00:24:04.900 - 00:24:08.466</b><br>so those are all really good statistics to have<br></p><p><b>00:24:09.400 - 00:24:11.200</b><br>so you can see there's a lot of things<br></p><p><b>00:24:11.200 - 00:24:13.500</b><br>he's got a lot of great ideas of things<br></p><p><b>00:24:13.500 - 00:24:14.700</b><br>coming in the future<br></p><p><b>00:24:15.600 - 00:24:18.000</b><br>so after the chart statistics<br></p><p><b>00:24:18.466 - 00:24:21.333</b><br>he's got the trade success statistics<br></p><p><b>00:24:21.333 - 00:24:23.266</b><br>so based on previously simulated trades<br></p><p><b>00:24:23.266 - 00:24:25.900</b><br>it is possible to determine if a chart is<br></p><p><b>00:24:25.900 - 00:24:27.300</b><br>quick fingers look friendly<br></p><p><b>00:24:27.466 - 00:24:30.900</b><br>and the probability of the current the probability<br></p><p><b>00:24:30.900 - 00:24:32.100</b><br>of the current<br></p><p><b>00:24:32.733 - 00:24:35.266</b><br>next trade resulting in a profit<br></p><p><b>00:24:35.866 - 00:24:38.300</b><br>so that's another really nice feature<br></p><p><b>00:24:38.733 - 00:24:40.300</b><br>anyway he says finally<br></p><p><b>00:24:40.300 - 00:24:42.766</b><br>I am open to the suggestions and feedback<br></p><p><b>00:24:42.766 - 00:24:44.700</b><br>just keep it friend so<br></p><p><b>00:24:46.066 - 00:24:48.166</b><br>he's going to put a lot more work into this<br></p><p><b>00:24:48.200 - 00:24:51.666</b><br>and he was kind enough to just start by showing us<br></p><p><b>00:24:51.933 - 00:24:53.466</b><br>what he's got so far<br></p><p><b>00:24:53.866 - 00:24:55.500</b><br>you know what his algorithm<br></p><p><b>00:24:55.500 - 00:24:58.533</b><br>visually is doing so it gives us a chart to look at<br></p><p><b>00:24:58.766 - 00:25:02.066</b><br>and I mean the next step to have a scanner<br></p><p><b>00:25:02.133 - 00:25:05.166</b><br>that alerts us when any of these bases crack<br></p><p><b>00:25:06.166 - 00:25:07.066</b><br>is awesome<br></p><p><b>00:25:07.300 - 00:25:09.466</b><br>right who does not want this tool<br></p><p><b>00:25:09.733 -
